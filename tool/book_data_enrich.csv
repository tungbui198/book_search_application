3,3302220,Microeconomía heterodoxa: Modelos sraffianos y marxistas,"Reseña:Esta obra está pensada para servir de complemento a un curso de microeconomía que tenga como fundamento un libro de texto marginalista o neoclásico. El tópico central es el análisis del valor y de la distribución en el llamado núcleo de una economía, con base en la consideración de los economistas clásicos. Se presenta primero el modelo clásico de precios de producción en su versión sraffiana –en particular, el efecto de las condiciones técnicas sobre los modelos de reproducción simple y la tasa de ganancia, el concepto de excedente, y la distribución entre capitalistas y trabajadores–. Se analiza a continuación una economía con más de una técnica, el concepto de capital, la Controversia del Capital de Cambridge y los efectos reales y los de precio de Wicksell. Luego se estudian modelos marxistas y se definen los conceptos básicos de valor trabajo, plusvalía y explotación –en particular, el teorema fundamental marxiano que muestra que no hay ganancia sin explotación–. Dentro del marco marxista se debate la forma correcta de realizar la conexión entre los valores y los precios de producción, lo que se llamó el problema de la transformación de valores en precios. Finalmente se consideran extensiones a modelos de producción conjunta (puros, de capital fijo y de renta diferencial para factores primarios escasos), preferencias y elección sobre bienes, y modelos dinámicos de inflación por puja distributiva.Sobre el autor:Es licenciado en Economía por la Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA, 1999), magíster en Economía por la Universidad de San Andrés (2002), y magíster en Estadística (2006) y doctor en Economía (2007) por la University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

7,3459738,Multigrammatical Framework for Knowledge-Based Digital Economy,"This monograph introduces a novel multiset-based conceptual, mathematical and knowledge engineering paradigm, called multigrammatical framework (MGF), used for planning and scheduling in resource-consuming, resource-producing (industrial) and resource-distributing (economical) sociotechnological systems (STS). This framework is meant to enable smart operation not only in a “business-as-usual” mode, but also in extraordinary, highly volatile or hazardous environments. It is the result of convergence and deep integration into a unified, flexible and effectively implemented formalism operating on multisets of several well-known paradigms from classical operations research and modern knowledge engineering, such as: mathematical programming, game theory, optimal scheduling, logic programming and constraint programming. The mathematical background needed for MGF, its algorithmics, applications, implementation issues, as well as its nexus with known models from operations research and theoretical computer science areas are considered. The resilience and recovery issues of an STS are studied by applying the MGF toolkit and on paying special attention to the multigrammatical assessment of resilience of energy infrastructures. MGF-represented resource-based games are introduced, and directions for further development are discussed. The author presents multiple applications to business intelligence, critical infrastructure, ecology, economy and industry. This book is addressed to scholars working in the areas of theoretical and applied computer science, artificial intelligence, systems analysis, operations research, mathematical economy and critical infrastructure protection, to engineers developing software-intensive solutions for implementation of the knowledge-based digital economy and Industry 4.0, as well as to students, aspirants and university staff. Foundational knowledge of set theory, mathematical logic and routine operations on data bases is needed to read this book. The content of the monograph is gradually presented, from simple to complex, in a well-understandable step-by-step manner. Multiple examples and accompanying figures are included in order to support the explanation of the various notions, expressions and algorithms.",467,2022,pdf,12 MB,['Igor A.

12,2850918,Economics and Math of Token Engineering and DeFi: Fundamentals of Token Economics,"Economics is a science. It primarily examines how decisions are made, which alternatives provide greatest benefits to various stakeholders. Contrary to popular belief, economics is not about money. It has and continues to be about the study of allocation of scarce resources (behaviours). We enforce them through incentives and disincentives (punishments).You don’t need to be an economist or technologist to understand the book. We keep things high-level to digest the information, yet coming from fundamental academic research.The difference between economics (soft science) and physics (hard science) is that economics is continuously evolves because it is a study of human behaviours. As we moved from Web 1 to Web 2 and now Web 3, the economics 101 that we initially understood has changed.While is important to be coding the tech infrastructure of Web 3.0 and having ideas of what Web 3.0 is like, an important aspect is the economics and incentive alignment of Web 3.0 users. It is easy to create a token or currency out of thin air. The token is only valuable when the economics make sense.The aim of this book is to dive into the core foundational principles of economics in Web 3.0. We explore the evolution to economics, the change in principles we learnt in Econs 101, and the new environment that economics will exist in.Then, we explore ways to apply these foundational principles in Web 3.0, with or without a token. We also tap into the general mathematics that defines the economic mechanisms.",364,2020,azw3,6 MB,['Lisa Jy Tan'],Economics Design,English,3.48,"['Economy', 'Mathematical Economics']",Math

39,1352908,An Explanation of Constrained Optimization for Economists,"In a constrained optimization problem, the decisionmaker wants to select the “optimal” choice – the one most valuable to him or her – that also meets all of the constraints imposed by the problem. Such problems are at the heart of modern economics, where the typical behavioral postulate is that a decisionmaker behaves “rationally”; that is, chooses optimally from a set of constrained choices.Most books on constrained optimization are technical and full of jargon that makes it hard for the inexperienced reader to gain a holistic understanding of the topic. Peter B. Morgan’s Explanation of Constrained Optimization for Economists solves this problem by emphasizing explanations, both written and visual, of the manner in which many constrained optimization problems can be solved. Suitable as a textbook or a reference for advanced undergraduate and graduate students familiar with the basics of one-variable calculus and linear algebra, this book is an accessible, user-friendly guide to this key concept.",504,2015,pdf,5 MB,['Peter Morgan'],"University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division",English,4.82,"['Economy', 'Mathematical Economics']",Math
40,1369021,Full Industry Equilibrium: A Theory of the Industrial Long Run,"This highly original book develops a systematic zero-net-profit comparative statics theory of the firm that challenges many widely held views in microeconomics. It builds a bridge between the marginalist long-run theory of the firm and Sraffian theory to create a unified theoretical framework that explains how firms react to exogenous shocks resulting in new equilibrium positions of the whole economy. The central message of the book is that too often economists expect more from the microeconomic laws of input demand and output supply than they can really give. The authors show that the zero-net-profit condition requires a more articulated analysis that sometimes yields qualitative results contrary to those of familiar economic laws. Written for academic researchers and graduate students, the book will be of particular interest to those working on the microeconomics of industry equilibrium, comparative statics and Sraffian economics.",232,2015,pdf,1021 kB,"['Arrigo Opocher', 'Ian Steedman']",Cambridge University Press,English,4.33,"['Economy', 'Mathematical Economics']",Math

Thus applying decision theory requires performing computations far beyond an ordinary decision-maker's ability. In this book Paul Weirich explains how individuals can simplify and streamline their choices. He shows how different 'parts' of options (intrinsic, temporal, spatiotemporal, causal) are separable, so that we can know what difference one part makes to the value of an option, regardless of what happens in the other parts. He suggests that the primary value of options is found in basic intrinsic attitudes towards outcomes: desires, aversions, or indifferences. And using these two facts he argues that we need only compare small parts of the options we face in order to make a rational decision. This important book will interest readers in decision theory, economics, and the behavioral sciences.",276,2015,pdf,1 MB,['Paul Weirich'],Cambridge University Press,English,4.17,"['Economy', 'Mathematical Economics']",Math

49,3759629,Stochastic Structural Optimization,"Stochastic Structural Optimization presents a comprehensive picture of robust design optimization of structures, focused on nonparametric stochastic-based methodologies. Good practical structural design accounts for uncertainty, for which reliability-based design offers a standard approach, usually incorporating assumptions on probability functions which are often unknown. By comparison, a worst-case approach with bounded support used as a robust design offers simplicity and a lower level of sensitivity. Linking structural optimization with these two approaches by a unified framework of non-parametric stochastic methodologies provides a rigorous theoretical background and high level of practicality. This text shows how to use this theoretical framework in civil and mechanical engineering practice to design a safe structure which accounts for uncertainty.Connects theory with practice in the robust design optimization of structuresAdvanced enough to support sound practical designsThis book provides comprehensive coverage for engineers and graduate students in civil and mechanical engineering.Makoto Yamakawa is a Professor at Tokyo University of Science, and a member of the Advisory Board of the 2020 Asian Congress of Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization.Makoto Ohsaki is a Professor at Kyoto University, Japan, treasurer of the International Association for Shell & Spatial Structures and former President of the Asian Society for Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization.",266,2023,pdf,24 MB,"['Makoto Yamakawa', 'Makoto Ohsaki']",CRC Press,English,4.8,"['Mathematics', 'Optimization.

50,3787908,Modern Optimization Methods for Decision Making Under Risk and Uncertainty,"The book comprises original articles on topical issues of risk theory, rational decision making, statistical decisions, and control of stochastic systems. The articles are the outcome of a series international projects involving the leading scholars in the field of modern stochastic optimization and decision making. The structure of stochastic optimization solvers is described. The solvers in general implement stochastic quasi-gradient methods for optimization and identification of complex nonlinear models. These models constitute an important methodology for finding optimal decisions under risk and uncertainty. While a large part of current approaches towards optimization under uncertainty stems from linear programming (LP) and often results in large LPs of special structure, stochastic quasi-gradient methods confront nonlinearities directly without need of linearization. This makes them an appropriate tool for solving complex nonlinear problems, concurrent optimization and simulation models, and equilibrium situations of different types, for instance, Nash or Stackelberg equilibrium situations. The solver finds the equilibrium solution when the optimization model describes the system with several actors. The solver is parallelizable, performing several simulation threads in parallel. It is capable of solving stochastic optimization problems, finding stochastic Nash equilibria, and of composite stochastic bilevel problems where each level may require the solution of stochastic optimization problem or finding Nash equilibrium. Several complex examples with applications to water resources management, energy markets, pricing of services on social networks are provided. In the case of power system, regulator makes decision on the final expansion plan, considering the strategic behavior of regulated companies and coordinating the interests of different economic entities.

53,3461466,Reinforcement Learning and Stochastic Optimization: A Unified Framework for Sequential Decisions,"REINFORCEMENT LEARNING AND STOCHASTIC OPTIMIZATIONClearing the jungle of stochastic optimization Sequential decision problems, which consist of “decision, information, decision, information,” are ubiquitous, spanning virtually every human activity ranging from business applications, health (personal and public health, and medical decision making), energy, the sciences, all fields of engineering, finance, and e-commerce. The diversity of applications attracted the attention of at least 15 distinct fields of research, using eight distinct notational systems which produced a vast array of analytical tools. A byproduct is that powerful tools developed in one community may be unknown to other communities. Reinforcement Learning and Stochastic Optimization offers a single canonical framework that can model any sequential decision problem using five core components: state variables, decision variables, exogenous information variables, transition function, and objective function. This book highlights twelve types of uncertainty that might enter any model and pulls together the diverse set of methods for making decisions, known as policies, into four fundamental classes that span every method suggested in the academic literature or used in practice. Reinforcement Learning and Stochastic Optimization is the first book to provide a balanced treatment of the different methods for modeling and solving sequential decision problems, following the style used by most books on machine learning, optimization, and simulation. The presentation is designed for readers with a course in probability and statistics, and an interest in modeling and applications. Linear programming is occasionally used for specific problem classes. The book is designed for readers who are new to the field, as well as those with some background in optimization under uncertainty. Throughout this book, readers will find references to over 100 different applications, spanning pure learning problems, dynamic resource allocation problems, general state-dependent problems, and hybrid learning/resource allocation problems such as those that arose in the COVID pandemic.

79,1450714,Advances in Combinatorial Optimization: Linear Programming Formulations of the Traveling Salesman and Other Hard Combinatorial Optimization Problems,"Combinational optimization (CO) is a topic in applied mathematics, decision science and computer science that consists of finding the best solution from a non-exhaustive search. CO is related to disciplines such as computational complexity theory and algorithm theory, and has important applications in fields such as operations research/management science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and software engineering.Advances in Combinatorial Optimization presents a generalized framework for formulating hard combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) as polynomial sized linear programs. Though developed based on the 'traveling salesman problem' (TSP), the framework allows for the formulating of many of the well-known NP-Complete COPs directly (without the need to reduce them to other COPs) as linear programs, and demonstrates the same for three other problems (e.g. the 'vertex coloring problem' (VCP)). This work also represents a proof of the equality of the complexity classes ""P"" (polynomial time) and ""NP"" (nondeterministic polynomial time), and makes a contribution to the theory and application of 'extended formulations' (EFs).On a whole, Advances in Combinatorial Optimization offers new modeling and solution perspectives which will be useful to professionals, graduate students and researchers who are either involved in routing, scheduling and sequencing decision-making in particular, or in dealing with the theory of computing in general.",220,2016,pdf,8 MB,"['Moustapha Diaby', 'Mark H.

81,4233606,Introduction to Probability for Computing,"Probability theory has become indispensable in computer science. It is at the core of machine learning and statistics, where one often needs to make decisions under stochastic uncertainty. It is also integral to computer science theory, where most algorithms today are randomized algorithms, involving random coin flips. It is a central part of performance modeling in computer networks and systems, where probability is used to predict delays, schedule jobs and resources, and provision capacity.This book gives an introduction to probability as it is used in computer science theory and practice, drawing on applications and current research developments as motivation and context. This is not a typical counting and combinatorics book, but rather it is a book centered on distributions and how to work with them. Every topic is driven by what computer science students need to know. For example, the book covers distributions that come up in computer science, such as heavy-tailed distributions. There is a large emphasis on variability and higher moments, which are very important in empirical computing distributions. Computer systems modeling and simulation are also discussed, as well as statistical inference for estimating parameters of distributions. Much attention is devoted to tail bounds, such as Chernoff bounds. Chernoff bounds are used for confidence intervals and also play a big role in the analysis of randomized algorithms, which themselves comprise a large part of the book. Finally, the book covers Markov chains, as well as a bit of queueing theory, both with an emphasis on their use in computer systems analysis.",571,2024,pdf,12 MB,['Mor Harchol-Balter'],Cambridge University Press (CUP),English,3.47,"['Mathematics', 'Probability']","Math, Probality"
82,4284939,"Introduction to Probability, Statistics & R: Foundations for Data-Based Sciences","A strong grasp of elementary statistics and probability, along with basic skills in using R, is essential for various scientific disciplines reliant on data analysis. This book serves as a gateway to learning statistical methods from scratch, assuming a solid background in high school mathematics. Readers gradually progress from basic concepts to advanced statistical modelling, with examples from actuarial, biological, ecological, engineering, environmental, medicine, and social sciences highlighting the real-world relevance of the subject. An accompanying R package enables seamless practice and immediate application, making it ideal for beginners. The book comprises 19 chapters divided into five parts. Part I introduces basic statistics and the R software package, teaching readers to calculate simple statistics and create basic data graphs. Part II delves into probability concepts, including rules and conditional probability, and introduces widelyused discrete and continuous probability distributions (e.g., binomial, Poisson, normal, log-normal). It concludes with the central limit theorem and joint distributions for multiple random variables. Part III explores statistical inference, covering point and interval estimation, hypothesis testing, and Bayesian inference. This part is intentionally less technical, making it accessible to readers without an extensive mathematical background. Part IV addresses advanced probability and statistical distribution theory, assuming some familiarity with (or concurrent study of) mathematical methods like advanced calculus and linear algebra. Finally, Part V focuses on advanced statistical modelling using simple and multiple regression and analysis of variance, laying the foundation for further studies in machine learning and data science applicable to various data and decision analytics contexts.",559,2024,pdf,12 MB,['Sujit K.

83,3463015,Statistical Modeling With R: a dual frequentist and Bayesian approach for life scientists,"To date, statistics has tended to be neatly divided into two theoretical approaches or frameworks: frequentist (or classical) and Bayesian. Scientists typically choose the statistical framework to analyse their data depending on the nature and complexity of the problem, and based on their personal views and prior training on probability and uncertainty. Although textbooks and courses should reflect and anticipate this dual reality, they rarely do so. This accessible textbook explains, discusses, and applies both the frequentist and Bayesian theoretical frameworks to fit the different types of statistical models that allow an analysis of the types of data most commonly gathered by life scientists. It presents the material in an informal, approachable, and progressive manner suitable for readers with only a basic knowledge of calculus and statistics. Statistical Modeling with R is aimed at senior undergraduate and graduate students, professional researchers, and practitioners throughout the life sciences, seeking to strengthen their understanding of quantitative methods and to apply them successfully to real world scenarios, whether in the fields of ecology, evolution, environmental studies, or computational biology.",518,2023,pdf,36 MB,['Pablo Inchausti'],Oxford University Press,English,4.75,"['Mathematics', 'Probability']","Math, Probality"

85,3585287,Telegraph Processes and Option Pricing,"This book provides an extensive, systematic overview of the modern theory of telegraph processes and their multidimensional counterparts, together with numerous fruitful applications in financial modelling. Focusing on stochastic processes of bounded variation instead of classical diffusion, or more generally, Lévy processes, has two obvious benefits. First, the mathematical technique is much simpler, which helps to concentrate on the key problems of stochastic analysis and applications, including financial market modelling. Second, this approach overcomes some shortcomings of the (parabolic) nature of classical diffusions that contradict physical intuition, such as infinite propagation velocity and infinite total variation of paths. In this second edition, some sections of the previous text are included without any changes, while most others have been expanded and significantly revised. These are supplemented by predominantly new results concerning piecewise linear processes with arbitrary sequences of velocities, jump amplitudes, and switching intensities. The chapter on functionals of the telegraph process has been significantly expanded by adding sections on exponential functionals, telegraph meanders and running extrema, the times of the first passages of telegraph processes with alternating random jumps, and distribution of the Euclidean distance between two independent telegraph processes. A new chapter on the multidimensional counterparts of the telegraph processes is also included.The book is intended for graduate students in mathematics, probability, statistics and quantitative finance, and for researchers working at academic institutions, in industry and engineering.

119,4216535,Many-Sorted Algebras for Deep Learning and Quantum Technology,"Many-Sorted Algebras for Deep Learning and Quantum Technology presents a precise and rigorous description of basic concepts in Quantum technologies and how they relate to Deep Learning and Quantum Theory. Current merging of Quantum Theory and Deep Learning techniques provides a need for a text that can give readers insight into the algebraic underpinnings of these disciplines. Although analytical, topological, probabilistic, as well as geometrical concepts are employed in many of these areas, algebra exhibits the principal thread. This thread is exposed using Many-Sorted Algebras (MSA). In almost every aspect of Quantum Theory as well as Deep Learning more than one sort or type of object is involved. For instance, in Quantum areas Hilbert spaces require two sorts, while in affine spaces, three sorts are needed. Both a global level and a local level of precise specification is described using MSA. At a local level operation involving neural nets may appear to be very algebraically different than those used in Quantum systems, but at a global level they may be identical. Again, MSA is well equipped to easily detail their equivalence through text as well as visual diagrams. Among the reasons for using MSA is in illustrating this sameness. Author Charles R. Giardina includes hundreds of well-designed examples in the text to illustrate the intriguing concepts in Quantum systems. Along with these examples are numerous visual displays. In particular, the Polyadic Graph shows the types or sorts of objects used in Quantum or Deep Learning. It also illustrates all the inter and intra sort operations needed in describing algebras. In brief, it provides the closure conditions. Throughout the text, all laws or equational identities needed in specifying an algebraic structure are precisely described.Key-Features:Includes hundreds of well-designed examples to illustrate the intriguing concepts in quantum systemsProvides precise description of all laws or equational identities that are needed in specifying an algebraic structureIllustrates all the inter and intra sort operations needed in describing algebras",422,2024,epub,6 MB,['Charles R.

120,3598101,Algebraic Theory for True Concurrency,"Algebraic Theory for True Concurrency presents readers with the algebraic laws for true concurrency. Parallelism and concurrency are two of the core concepts within computer science. This book covers the different realms of concurrency, which enables programs, algorithms or problems to be broken out into order-independent or partially ordered components to improve computation and execution speed. There are two primary approaches for executing concurrency: interleaving concurrency and true concurrency. The main representative of interleaving concurrency is bisimulation/rooted branching bisimulation equivalences which is also readily explored. This work eventually founded the comprehensive axiomatization modulo bisimulation equivalence -- ACP (Algebra of Communicating Processes).The other approach to concurrency is true concurrency. Research on true concurrency is active and includes many emerging applications. First, there are several truly concurrent bisimulation equivalences, including: pomset bisimulation equivalence, step bisimulation equivalence, history-preserving (hp-) bisimulation equivalence, and hereditary history-preserving (hhp-) bisimulation equivalence, the most well-known truly concurrent bisimulation equivalence.",227,2023,pdf,7 MB,['Yong Wang'],Academic Press,English,3.06,"['Mathematics', 'Algebra']","Math, Algebra"

The aim of the book is to summarize the achievements to date in the subject and to present them in the form of a logically created theory. Through appropriate grading and a precise description of the steps of the proofs, this theory is easily assimilated, and it should not take too long for the reader to learn about it.We begin with the motivation for their creation, many examples, and basic results used later in the book. Then we deal with the constructions of BCC-algebras and calculate the numbers of their subalgebras.The author describes the so-called solid weak BCC-algebras. They have some properties of BCI-algebras, but this requires completely new, often difficult, proofs. The important subclasses of weak BCC-algebras and the relationships between them are presented with many examples. BCC-Algebras is intended for researchers dealing with abstract algebra and for logicians working on the border between logic and algebra. The book is also of interest to students interested in the theory of (weak) BCC-algebras or simply in abstract algebra.

It succeeds in combining the advantages of rings-first and groups-first approaches while avoiding the disadvantages. After an historical overview, the first chapter studies familiar examples and elementary properties of groups and rings simultaneously to motivate the modern understanding of algebra. The text builds intuition for abstract algebra starting from high school algebra. In addition to the standard number systems, polynomials, vectors, and matrices, the first chapter introduces modular arithmetic and dihedral groups. The second chapter builds on these basic examples and properties, enabling students to learn structural ideas common to rings and groups: isomorphism, homomorphism, and direct product. The third chapter investigates introductory group theory. Later chapters delve more deeply into groups, rings, and fields, including Galois theory, and they also introduce other topics, such as lattices. The exposition is clear and conversational throughout.The book has numerous exercises in each section as well as supplemental exercises and projects for each chapter.

145,3081390,How to Think About Abstract Algebra,"How to Think about Abstract Algebra provides an engaging and readable introduction to its subject, which encompasses group theory and ring theory. Abstract Algebra is central in most undergraduate mathematics degrees, and it captures regularities that appear across diverse mathematicalstructures - many people find it beautiful for this reason. But its abstraction can make its central ideas hard to grasp, and even the best students might find that they can follow some of the reasoning without really understanding what it is all about.This book aims to solve that problem. It is not like other Abstract Algebra texts and is not a textbook containing standard content. Rather, it is designed to be read before starting an Abstract Algebra course, or as a companion text once a course has begun. It builds up key information on fivetopics: binary operations, groups, quotient groups, isomorphisms and homomorphisms, and rings. It provides numerous examples, tables and diagrams, and its explanations are informed by research in mathematics education.The book also provides study advice focused on the skills that students need in order to learn successfully in their own Abstract Algebra courses.

Dazu werden die fundamentalen begrifflichen Abstraktionen der Algebra – Gruppe, Ring und Körper – definiert, erklärt und durch Bezüge zu anderen Bereichen der Mathematik sowie der alltäglichen Anschauung mit Leben gefüllt. Gleichzeitig wird der Anwendungsbereich der elementaren Galois-Theorie erweitert, zum Beispiel von Körpererweiterungen über den rationalen Zahlen zu Körpererweiterungen über beliebigen Körpern.Der Zugang ist konsequent konstruktiv: anstelle von abstrakten Existenzbeweisen treten konstruktive Verfahren, Lösungen algorithmisch zu berechnen. Dies führt zu vielfältigeren Anwendungsmöglichkeiten der Ergebnisse sowie zu einer konzeptionellen Klarheit und einer schärferen Sicht auf die Zusammenhänge. Der Leser wird dadurch an moderne Entwicklungen herangeführt, etwa in der Topostheorie oder der (Homotopie-)Typentheorie, wo eine Sensibilität für konstruktive Schlussweisen zentral ist.Der Inhalt knüpft an das Lehrbuch „Elementare Galois-Theorie“ desselben Autors an, kann aber auch aufbauend auf eher klassischen Einführungen in die Algebra gewinnbringend gelesen werden.

165,3330570,Полынная ёлка,"Никто не любит предисловий. Читатель не любит их читать, а писатель – писать. Потому что это словно ты уже стоишь на опушке леса, на берегу интересной истории, а взрослые держат тебя за руку и объясняют, какие в лесу водятся звери, какие растения нельзя брать в рот и что кричать, когда заблудишься. Нет, хочется скорее туда, в таинственный, страшный лес, чтобы самому во всём разобраться.Поэтому я не обижусь, если вы сначала прочитаете историю, а потом решите, нужно вам или нет перекинуться парой слов с автором. Если посчитаете, что нужно, возвращайтесь сюда, в начало.А началось всё давно. Даже не в моем детстве, а когда Генриху было лет 13–14. Он сражался с волком. Была ночь. Волчара вцепился в жеребёнка сзади и тянул его к себе, а Генрих держал жеребёнка за голову и пытался втащить его к себе, в шалаш. Отпускать было нельзя. Ни за что. Волк был один, и Генрих был один. Волк был большой и голодный. А Генрих очень низкого роста, тощий и ещё более голодный. Удивительно, что фамилия у Генриха была Вольф, в переводе с немецкого – Волк. Все родные у мальчишки были очень далеко, а мама и вовсе умерла, поэтому никто не собирал ему на работу узелок с едой. Какая семья была у волка – никто никогда не узнает. Но для кого-то же он пытался украсть жеребёнка. Волк хотел есть, а Генрих хотел жить.Оба тянули жеребёнка молча. Такая вот тихая схватка. Остальные жеребята и кобылы сбились в кучу и жалобно ржали. У Генриха не осталось сил звать на помощь, пальцы онемели. Надо было дотерпеть до рассвета. Чтобы выжить, надо было просто не разжимать пальцы и терпеть, и тогда, возможно, помощь придёт. Если сдашься, то за потерю колхозного имущества мальчишку ждала трудармия, а то и расстрел. Шла война.Утром мимо проехал на коне местный колхозник с ружьем. Выстрелил – волк убежал. А Генриху пришлось ещё долго разжимать пальцы, чтобы отцепиться от жеребёнка.Когда я для школьных сочинений и просто ради интереса спрашивала своего дедушку Андрея (так звать его было уже привычней, чем Генрих) о его детстве, о том, что пришлось пережить, о том, кто виноват в ужасах, что выпали на жизнь его поколения, он говорил нехотя, очень скупо, без подробностей, обид и обвинений, подводя черту под разговором: «Время было такое».Дедушка умер рано – сердце не выдержало. Он был весёлым человеком, любил петь и плясать, всегда охотно играл и возился с ребятнёй, а своих детей и внуков называл «вы мои золотые». Его семья была первой в деревне, в которой немец женился на русской. Этому не радовались родные Генриха. Да и не все родные Екатерины смогли смириться.Дети и внуки были главной ценностью и счастьем жизни интернациональной семьи. Если бы Генрих не молчал и не терпел, нас могло бы и не быть. Время было такое – опасно говорить правду, опасно делать то, что не одобрено партией. Наверное, дедушка и представить себе не мог, что я когда-то напишу эту книгу.Но времена меняются. Только дедушку я расспросить уже не могу. Все подробности мне рассказывает моя бывшая учительница немецкого языка Мария Андреевна и её супруг. Они с Генрихом ехали в одном поезде, который увозил их из родных мест, жили в одном селе. Мария Андреевна – это Марийхе, героиня повести «Полынная ёлка». Она выжила, выросла, выучилась, помогала закладывать первый в селе сад с первыми в этом районе яблоневыми деревьями (тогда в предгорьях Алтая яблок не выращивали). В селе душевного человека и замечательного педагога любили и уважали. И только «начальство», бывало, портило жизнь. Один из глупых местных руководителей пытался обвинить учительницу… в шпионаже. Другой пытался дать поручение – слушать и рассказывать, чем занимаются на религиозных собраниях местные немцы-лютеране. Третий запретил в Доме культуры концерт, который подготовила немецкая диаспора района. И семья Марийхе первая из местных немцев приняла решение эмигрировать в Германию. Тогда это требовало мужества. Никто не знал, будет ли возможность ещё когда-то увидеться с теми, кто остаётся в Советском союзе.Мы долго говорим. Слушать – страшно. Представлять – ещё страшнее. Оправдать невозможно. Не знать – нельзя. Эти истории – словно протянутая из прошлого рука. Та, что поможет тебе в трудную минуту. Я чувствую её и в серьёзном, и в мелочах. Однажды меня высадили из поезда, что-то напутали с билетом. Я была готова разреветься от такой несправедливости, стоя на перроне в незнакомом городе, когда мои вещи спокойненько едут себе в купе в сторону дома. И… рассмеялась, вспомнив, как добирался домой без билетов, еды и документов, с подгоревшими ногами, один из моих героев. Он был мальчишкой и – смог. И теперь своей обожжённой рукой он словно встряхнул меня за шиворот или дал подбадривающий подзатыльник. Какой глупостью на этом фоне показались мне мои проблемы.Я радуюсь каждому моменту жизни, несмотря на неприятности и на то или иное время. Время – оно проходит. А что-то внутри тебя остаётся навсегда. Просто, если трудно, нужно не разжимать пальцы и дотерпеть до утра.Полынная ёлкаС благодарностью и любовью – Марии Андреевне и Геннадию Теодоровичу Фитц, решившим рассказать свои истории, а также Андрею Александровичу Вольфу, который всё помнил, но старался не рассказывать",88,2017,epub,2 MB,['Колпакова Ольга Валериевна'],КомпасГид,Russian,3.99,"['Literature', 'Children']","Literature, Children"

178,3636599,Scaling Impact: Finance and Investment for a Better World,"The global challenges confronting us ― climate change, poverty, inequality, and many others ― can feel overwhelming. Those of us who believe in market-based solutions to these challenges get even more disheartened when we regularly see our existing capitalist system failing us, often causing more harm than good. Many examples show how the capitalist tools of finance and investment can and make real, positive impact. Approaches like blended finance and impact investing can help accelerate progress against the world’s biggest remaining collective challenges. Yet use of these improved capitalist approaches remains far too subscale. Blended finance and impact investing remain 15 to 200 times smaller than traditional approaches to finance and investment. How can we continue to make capitalism work better by scaling these approaches and others? This book looks at how we can start making these necessary changes using strategies, structures, and practices that take advantage of capitalism's strengths. Its goal is to demonstrate how a reimagined financial system can be more inclusive and accountable to all. By shifting away from extractive, short-term practices in the name of shareholder primacy, we can move toward a system that values the role of all stakeholders.",268,2023,pdf,5 MB,['Kusisami Hornberger'],Palgrave Macmillan,English,3.78,"['Business', 'Trading']","Literature, Comic"

182,3699152,"Private Equity Financing in Infrastructure and Real Estate: Impact, Strategies, and Value Addition","This book provides a comprehensive overview of Private Equity (PE) financing in the infrastructure and real estate sectors. In doing so, it analyzes the impact of such investments in the two sectors, evaluates the types of financing strategies, and explores the value created by such investments. Infrastructure and Real Estate have emerged as a significant asset class for PE investors. In the last three decades, PE firms have invested significant amounts of capital in infrastructure and real estate – sectors which did not feature in their radar before 2000. Between 2000 and 2009, PE firms invested more than USD 200 billion in infrastructure. Real estate sector also witnessed investments of a similar scale as that of infrastructure. Fundraising for infrastructure and real estate was about USD 100 billion and USD 150 billion respectively in 2019, setting new records and reaching all-time highs. This book examines such PE investments – both at a global level and at an emerging economy level, to identify how PE firms have created an impact with their investments, to provide both ready capital and value-addition to sectors which seem to urgently need both. The book is divided into three sections – impact of PE investments, strategies used by PE firms, and value created by such investments. The findings of this research and the corresponding best practices are useful and applicable to students, academicians, researchers, financial institutions, policy makers and law makers, commercial banks and funding agencies, practitioners, the Government, and other parties who are directly or indirectly associated with the development of infrastructure and real estate; and could aid funding agencies, practitioners and policy makers who are directly responsible for creating and developing infrastructure and real estate for their economies.",226,2023,pdf,5 MB,"['Josephine Gemson', 'Thillai Rajan A.']",Springer,English,3.48,"['Business', 'Trading']","Literature, Comic"
183,3721020,Investors’ Preferences in Financing New Ventures: A Data Mining Approach to Equity,"This book aims at providing an empirical understanding of the main drivers affecting investors’ preferences in financing new ventures through equity crowdfunding (ECF) and determining fundraising campaign success. ECF is increasing in prominence as a route for new ventures in obtaining external financial resources. To raise capital, entrepreneurs are required to convey quality signals of their proposals with real-time information and knowledge sharing. This book advances knowledge in entrepreneurial finance by investigating the factors that affect individuals’ decisions to participate in ECF. The authors adopt a data mining approach to extract publicly available information from a multitude of crowdfunding platforms across different countries, producing a unique dataset. The book uses an innovative hybrid analysis to generate knowledge patterns creating data-driven models on one hand, and on the other test research hypotheses adopting statistical models to investigate empirical evidence in line, or in contrast, with the extant literature. The book also integrates organizational theories to examine the extent to which ECF platform managers follow a strategy of isomorphism in their choice of information disclosure. The final part of the book discusses how signals are interpreted by investors, how these affect financing preferences, and ultimately the successful completion of a fundraising campaign. The book will be of interest to academics and practitioners in entrepreneurial finance, FinTech, and investment behaviour.",155,2023,pdf,4 MB,"['Francesco James Mazzocchini', 'Caterina Lucarelli']",Palgrave Pivot,English,3.93,"['Business', 'Trading']","Literature, Comic"
184,3755467,Understanding Crypto Fundamentals: Value Investing in Cryptoassets and Management of Underlying Risks,"Saying that many investors were not convinced by cryptocurrencies in their first decade of existence would be an understatement.Originally, author Thomas Jeegers was one of them. He looked into this new virtual money more than once and, each time, decided not to invest. Like many long-term investors, he was looking for fundamentals. Crypto had none — or so he thought. This book details why his perspective on cryptoassets has shifted – and why yours should, too.Recent developments in this field have turned crypto from a speculative financial innovation to a new asset class, one with a new kind of fundamentals that offer real economic value. One that will change finance and investments. One that may be a trigger defining the fourth industrial revolution, the same way steam, electricity, and the Internet were triggers for the first, second, and third industrial revolutions, respectively.Despite what advocates of the traditional financial establishment like to claim, cryptoassets were by far the best financial investment of the last decade, even risk-adjusted, and could still be so for the coming one. They should not be overlooked, regardless of one’s opinion of them.This book answers the main questions any potential long-term investor in cryptoassets should ask:What are cryptoassets and blockchain technology?Why consider cryptoasset investments?When is a good time to invest?Where should one invest?How should one invest?Which valuation methods are appropriate?Understanding Crypto Fundamentals includes a deep dive into the management of risks specific to cryptoassets, both financial and non-financial, and provides the tools needed for investment success in this new asset class. Upon completing the book, you will have a new perspective on cryptoassets and how you can benefit from them as an investor.",315,2023,pdf,8 MB,['Thomas Jeegers'],Apress,English,4.87,"['Business', 'Trading']","Literature, Comic"

New banking and finance technologies may improve operational efficiency, risk management, compliance, and client pleasure, but they can decrease barriers and introduce new concerns, such as cybersecurity risk.Cryptocurrencies with smart contracts for payments and trading, as well as AI systems with adaptive algorithms that allow picture and speech recognition, expert judgement, group categorization, and forecasting in a variety of fields, are instances of increased automation.

194,3381319,Sustainable: Moving Beyond ESG to Impact Investing,"Should business and finance play larger roles in resolving the great social and environmental challenges of our time? Proponents of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing say yes. They argue that ESG financial strategies can help reverse runaway carbon emissions and fix income and gender inequalities, among other ills. ESG-integrated investments already encompass more than $120 trillion in financial assets. Are they working as promised? If not, how can they be improved?In Sustainable, a finance-industry veteran offers an insider’s look at the promises, prospects, and perils of ESG investing. Terrence Keeley argues that many ESG advocates have been overly optimistic about what it can accomplish. Divestment threats are ineffective tools for altering corporate behavior, and verifiably “good” companies do not systematically generate great returns. Most importantly, business and finance cannot cure social ills on their own: regulators, public policies, civil society, and individuals must all play specific, complementary roles to shape the future we want. Keeley provides comprehensive solutions that would promote more inclusive, sustainable growth. In particular, he recommends reallocating capital from some indexed products toward an emerging class of strategies with more verifiable social and environmental benefits. Keeley identifies dozens of alternative “impact investing” strategies that could generate true double bottom lines. He also highlights promising civic organizations with proven methodologies for achieving widely shared benefits at scale.Proposing practical, actionable, and in many cases profitable solutions to social and environmental problems, Sustainable offers an incisive vision of the roles business and finance can and should play in building a flourishing society.",320,2022,pdf,15 MB,['Terrence Keeley'],Columbia Business School Publishing,English,3.19,"['Business', 'Trading']","Literature, Comic"

202,3637583,"Quantitative Hedge Funds: Discretionary, Systematic, AI, ESG And Quantamental","Welcome to the secretive club of modern hedge funds, where important players in the world of investing and capital markets have invested close to $4 trillion globally. If you're intrigued by the inner workings of hedge funds, investment techniques and technologies they use to source investment alpha, this book is for you. Focusing on the author's three decades of trading experience at leading banks and hedge funds, it covers both discretionary and computer-driven strategies and perspectives on AI-based and quantamental investing using new alternative data, which includes numerous examples and insights of real trades and investment strategies. No mathematical knowledge is required, with the relevant algorithms detailed in the appendices. Discretionary investing details equity and credit investing across the corporate capital structure. Through trading equities, bonds and loans, event-driven trades can target profitable special situations and relative value opportunities. Systematic trading involves computer-driven strategies derived from a scientific and statistical analysis of liquid markets. The investment strategies of both commodity trading advisors (CTAs) and long/short equity funds are detailed, from trend-following to factor-based approaches. AI investing is fashionable but does the reality for hedge funds correspond to the AI hype present in other non-financial domains? AI using neural nets and other machine learning techniques are outlined along with their practical application in regards to investing.

Most retail traders focus too much on technical analysis. However, this is not a sufficient trading tool if one wants to succeed as a trader.A lot of the educational content that you see online is also too focused on technical analysis alone. This is a tool that you’ll need as a currency trader, but it is not the most important tool.In fact, bank traders and hedge fund traders don’t even use a lot of indicators. Their charts are often very clean since they are using other tools to analyse the markets.To become a successful forex trader, you’ll need to have the whole package. That is why in this currency trading book, I’ll teach you the various tools you’ll need to succeed as a forex trader. You’ll learn:Basic terms and principles of currency tradingFundamental analysis (economic indicators, central banks, monetary policies, currency fundamentals)Sentiment analysis (high yield and low yield currencies, fear index)Introduction to Brokers (types, criteria for picking, action plan)Price action strategies (candlestick patterns, support & resistance, trendlines, moving averages, and momentum indicators)Risk management tools and application Trading psychology hacks Trading plan (template included)Trading journal (template included)How to sustain your trading businessBONUS: Useful websites for tradersSo much more……Add these tools to your trading plan and you’ll be able to increase the probability of your trades. Most forex traders trade in a bubble relying too much on indicators alone, that is why they lose.Most retail forex traders also do not bother to look at other markets and use the power of correlations to their advantage. I’ll share with you in this currency trading book on how you can conduct intermarket analysis as well.Experienced currency traders can also pick up some new trading hacks or even use this book as a refresher. Non-trading professionals will also be able to learn how the various economic indicators can affect their lives and the overall economy.At the end of this trading book, I’ll share with you tips and tricks on how you can sustain your trading account and trading business.

Hochberg comes an illuminating and engaging tutorial on the basics of modern trade. Trade—the exchange that powers the world—allows us to sell what we produce at home and purchase what we don’t. In the age of globalization, trade has joined together more people than ever before, providing access to major new markets and countless new products that have revolutionized our lives.However, for millions of people, global trade has become a popular target for blame and the frustrations of modern life. Much of the public only connects trade with unfathomable, high-level deals causing the fundamental principles to often seem inaccessible and confusing. Through the lens of six quintessential American goods, Fred P. Hochberg breaks down colorful and compelling real-world examples to dispel the widespread myths and confusions surrounding trade. By using six widely consumed American goods—the taco salad, the iPhone, the classic apple pie, the minivan, Game of Thrones, and the baseball cap—Hochberg highlights the story of America’s most surprising trade relationships while sharing the essentials of trade that everyone should know.",336,2020,epub,15 MB,['Fred P.

It shouldn’t take a worldwide pandemic and nationwide protests to bring economic and racial inequality to the forefront of problems we desperately need to solve. But now that the opportunity is here, what should we do? How can we create more equality, opportunity, and growth for everyone? Not someday, but what can government and the private sector do right now to disrupt a status quo that almost everyone wants to change?In Common Sense, the New York Times best-selling author Joel Greenblatt offers an investor’s perspective on building an economy that truly works for everyone. With dry wit and engaging storytelling, he makes a lively and provocative case for disruptive new approaches―some drawn from personal experience, some from the outside looking in. How can leading corporations immediately disrupt our education establishment while creating high-paying job opportunities for those currently left behind? If we want a living wage for everyone, how can we afford it while using an existing program to get it done now? If we subsidize banks, what simple changes can we make to the way we capitalize and regulate them to help grow the economy, increase access, and create more jobs (while keeping the risks and benefits where they belong)? Greenblatt also explains how dramatically increasing immigration would be like giving every American a giant bonus and the reason Australia might be the best place to learn about saving for retirement.Not everyone will agree with what Greenblatt has to say―but all of us can benefit from the conversations he aims to start.",144,2020,epub,287 kB,['Joel Greenblatt'],Columbia Business School Publishing,English,3.53,"['Business', 'Trading']","Literature, Comic"

You’ve had an idea and have done some preliminary experiments, and it looks promising. Where do you go from here? Well, this book discusses and dissects this case study approach. Seemingly good backtest performance isn't enough to justify trading real money. You need to perform rigorous statistical tests of the system's validity. Then, if basic tests confirm the quality of your idea, you need to tune your system, not just for best performance, but also for robust behavior in the face of inevitable market changes. Next, you need to quantify its expected future behavior, assessing how bad its real-life performance might actually be, and whether you can live with that. Finally, you need to find its theoretical performance limits so you know if its actual trades conform to this theoretical expectation, enabling you to dump the system if it does not live up to expectations.This book does not contain any sure-fire, guaranteed-riches trading systems.

Trading space is no longer measured in minutes or seconds but in time units beyond human perception: milliseconds, microseconds, and even nanoseconds. Technological advances have thus scaled up imperceptible and previously irrelevant time differences into operationally manageable and enormously profitable business opportunities for those with the proper high-tech trading tools. These tools include the fastest private communication and trading lines, the most powerful computers and sophisticated algorithms capable of speedily analysing incoming news and trading data and determining optimal trading strategies in microseconds, as well as the possession of gigantic collections of historic and real-time market data. Fragmented capital markets are also becoming a rapidly growing reality in Europe and Asia, and are an established feature of U.S. trading. This raises urgent market governance issues that have largely been overlooked.

227,2434640,Bite the Ass Off a Bear: Getting In and Standing Out On a Hedge Fund Trading Floor,"Contrary to Hollywood mythologizing, there are no wolves on Wall Street. Ruthless, greedy, and power-hungry individualists actually make terrible hedge-fund traders. If you’re going to succeed in this business, you need to understand not only how America’s financial markets work, but how being a team player makes you the most valuable asset to your company and clients. In Bite the Ass Off a Bear, investment professional Garth Friesen reveals how hedge-fund traders thrive by developing the interpersonal skills necessary to act and react in a high-stakes field with integrity, reliability, and stress control. For aspiring and experienced traders, having a strong work ethic, persistent attitude, and likeable personality are just as essential as mathematical and computer acumen and will take your career further than fabled lone-wolf tactics. With indispensable information from a Wall Street insider, this book will prepare you for a challenging industry that’s as full of risks as it is of rewards. Garth Friesen, a principal since 1998 at a well-known hedge-fund manager at III Capital Management, has served in multiple capacities at the firm, including Co-Chief Investment Officer. Garth has specific investment expertise in numerous markets, including fixed income, equities, and credit and interest-rate derivatives. He has been featured in various media, including CNBC, Bloomberg, and The Wall Street Journal, among others. He served as a member for five years on the esteemed New York Fed's Investor Advisory Committee on Financial Markets. Prior to joining III Capital Management, he was an interest-rate swaps market-maker for two Wall Street banks.Reader Review:""Enjoyable stories from trading desks as well as insight on what it takes for longevity in the trading profession.The author details important, and often overlooked, soft skills such as control of emotions and willingness to learn from mistakes. He also jumps into practical applications, including stop-loss triggers and operating with lower levels of confidence. For example, “Placing a stop-loss too far from the entry point, skew(s) the upside versus downside of a trade.”He shows great appreciation for the impact of psychological influences on trading and investing, with thorough discussion of behavioral biases like risk aversion and overconfidence. Rather than simply list such attributes, he demonstrates personal application:“When I first started, I viewed the game as me against the market. Now, I consider the game as me against other people. Identifying the consensus view and how other participants are positioned in various trades has become one of my most important (potential trade) evaluation criteria.”Overall, I enjoyed the book as an educational tool and confirmation that “moving from the theoretical academic world to the practical world of finance is hard.”“The long hours, pressure to continually perform, and the stress of losing substantial amounts of money make trading an extremely demanding occupation.”Some folks cannot handle the constant feedback. Compare this to most industries where performance reviews happen on an annual basis.”Trading by way of quantitative algorithms gets so much press these days. This book is a refreshing look at the creative and dynamic human trader, continuing to thrive despite the computer advances in artificial intelligence and deep learning.""",270,2017,azw,430 kB,['Garth Friesen'],Lioncrest Publishing,English,4.25,"['Business', 'Trading']","Literature, Comic"

Theefforts of the Siamese state to control this area was a reaction to the chaotic situation innorthern Siam and the increasing amount of foreign investment in the teak business.During the 1890s, the Siamese government was unable to cope with the expansion of the teaktrade, thus it founded the Royal Forest Department in 1897. Pertinently, teak was not subjectto the trade conditions stipulated by the Bowring Treaty. As such, the Siamese governmentmaintained autonomy regarding its decision-making and policy on teak. By doing so, Siamwas able to control and nationalise the teak forests. As a result, income from teak immenselycontributed to the governmental coffers. This dissertation, moreover, unveils the role ofprivate companies and documents the multi-ethnic work structures which were so significantto the development of the teak industry. Another discovery of the dissertation details theindispensable role played by private companies in terms of setting up this system ofproduction, extracting teak from the forest, and delivering it to foreign markets.After the establishment of the Royal Forest Department, European companies dominated theteak business because they were able to conform to governmental regulations. In particular,these companies wielded a competitive advantage because they had access to global financialand shipping services, both of which were necessary to compete in the global economy. As aresult, in brief, European companies were able to control and prosper from the teak trade.Teak exports, however, declined after the First World War and eventually became lessimportant in both the global and Siamese economies. Indeed, teak ceased to be a major exportitem for Siam in the 1930s.",256,2016,pdf,4 MB,['Amnuayvit Thitibordin'],,English,4.34,"['Business', 'Trading']","Literature, Comic"

239,4227297,Data-Driven Decision Making in Entrepreneurship: Tools for Maximizing Human Capital,"Since the beginning of the 21st century, there has been an explosion in startup organizations. Together, these organizations have been valued at over $3 trillion. In 2019, alone, nearly $300 billion of venture capital was invested globally (Global Startup Ecosystem Report 2020). Simultaneously, an explosion in high volume and high velocity of big data is rapidly changing how organizations function. Gone are the days where organizations can make decisions solely on intuition, logic, or experience. Some have gone as far as to say that data is the most valuable currency and resource available to businesses, and startups are no exception. However, startups and small businesses do differ from their larger counterparts and corporations in three distinct ways: 1) they tend to have fewer resources, time, and specialized training to devote to data analytics; 2) they are part of a unique entrepreneurial ecosystem with unique needs; 3) scholarship and academic research on human capital data analytics in startups is lacking. Existing entrepreneurship research focuses almost exclusively on macro-level aspects. There has been little to no integration of micro- and meso-level research (i.e., individual and team sciences), which is unfortunate given how organizational scientists have significantly advanced human capital data analytics.Unlike other books focused on data analytics and decision for organizations, this proposed book is purposefully designed to be more specifically aimed at addressing the unique idiosyncrasies of the science, research, and practice of startups. Each chapter highlights a specific organizational domain and discuss how a novel data analytic technique can help enhance decision-making, provides a tutorial of said regarding the data analytic technique, and lists references and resources for the respective data analytic technique. The volume will be grounded in sound theory and practice of organizational psychology, entrepreneurship and management and is divided into two parts: assessing and evaluating human capital performance and the use of data analytics to manage human capital.",314,2024,pdf,13 MB,"['Nikki Blackmith', 'Maureen E.

247,3431967,"The Future of Management, Volume 2: Industry 4.0 and Digitalization","The world is standing on the very edge of the fastest industrial revolution ever. A revolution which will rapidly increase the efficiency of many production processes. Automation (both mechanical and the one happening with computer processes) will reduce the demand for human work and release a huge amount of time we can use for further development. Industry 4.0 has been a buzz word recently. It is about interconnecting devices and giving them the possibility to making autonomous decisions. It is certainly a way of increasing efficiency of production, but it will also have impact on the facilitation of other processes within the organization.At the same time, it is said that we are on the verge of an ecological catastrophe and that we have merely a few years before irreversible climate changes may endanger the future of our species. Some say, that the development of AI will solve most of our problems.

252,3602190,The Power of Humility in Leadership: Influencing as a Role Model,"To many people, the words ‘leader’ and ‘humble’ are not natural bedfellows. Yet once they have grasped the definition most employees desire a humble leader, while a majority of managers believe they already are one. What appears deceptively simple is trickier than expected. Narcissism, lack of perception, fixed mindsets, and neuronal default settings are only a few of the stumbling blocks on the path to humility. What exactly is this sought-after humility? Humility consists of four key elements: 1) Seeing one’s own strength and weaknesses and revealing them where needed for the bigger picture; 2) Appreciating others for what they are, do now and can do; 3) Being open and willing to learn; 4) Understanding that we are all only a small part of a larger picture, easily replaceable and favored by luck and circumstance. Therefore, humility has nothing to do with being weak or hiding the light under the bushel. Instead, it is about clarity, taking a step back from one’s ego and thus being able to serve the greater picture. The author’s own research with more than 3,500 managers contributes to the canon of positive effects of humility that have been measured by dozens of researchers during the last decade. Humility benefits employees (ranging from better performance, more innovation, stronger resilience to better client relations, and stronger morals), the organization (ranging from better ambidextrous strategies, a better culture to fewer sunk costs) and the managers themselves (ranging from more seen leadership potential to less stress and better relationships with employees). Dozens of case studies, quotes from more than 170 interviews with top managers, lively storytelling of real-life examples, and solid research with actionable take-aways, plus personal assessments, make this an eminently readable and practical book for managers worldwide.",328,2023,pdf,23 MB,['Franziska Frank'],Routledge/Productivity Press,English,4.19,"['Business', 'Management']",Computer
253,3634206,Managing for Social Justice: Harnessing Management Theory and Practice for Collective Good,"The book introduces a preliminary, integrative conceptual framework on the intersections between management and social justice with a view that the quest for social justice is not an endpoint rather an ongoing journey. With contributions from management scholars and practitioners, it highlights, examines, and explores the continuities and discontinuities, gains and losses, and struggles and successes in this quest for reimagining organizations as sites and vehicles for advancing social justice in the world. To nurture and facilitate flourishing individuals and collectives, we need bolder, more innovative, and more creative models of engagement. Further, we need models for speaking and learning from different perspectives and building common ground through shared values of equity, connectivity, and compassion and moral expansiveness while recognizing the complexities of the world we inhabit via our organizations and the need to develop nuanced understandings of the same.Contributing authors address questions such as: Are social justice and management mutually exclusive concepts? How can we draw on effective management for advancing social justice aims? How do we bend the arc of organizational life towards more justice? What are the rights and obligations of organizations and their members to the world at large, and to their local communities and societies?Through its re-imagining of organizations and management as vehicles for social justice instead of just as tools of oppression, injustice, or regressive organizing in an extractive economy, this book brings together critical and positive organizational approaches challenging fundamental assumptions about how our society, people’s collectives, and workplaces are organized with capacity building, incremental change, sustained change, institutionalized change, dynamic ongoing problem-solving/ assessment/ redesign, and more. Management scholars will learn the nuanced and complex intersections between management theories and practice and different types of justice/injustice in a global context both as antecedents to modern organizations and workplaces and the ways in which these intersectional actors advance and change the organizations and workplaces of the future.",562,2023,pdf,8 MB,"['Latha Poonamallee', 'Anita D.

258,3642471,A New Approach to Cross-Cultural People Management: People are People,"When managing cross-culturally in a polarized world, recognizing similarities between people and establishing common ground can be key to success. This book argues that despite differences in language, political systems, income levels, and other factors, people are people. There is no doubt that cultural differences should be understood and appreciated, not only because this is the right thing to do in a multicultural world, but because failure to understand these differences when doing business can result in costly mistakes. But when managing people, what matters most is showing respect and interest – because what motivates (and de-motivates) is the same regardless of cultural background. This book explains and illustrates eight themes in which people are very similar across cultures, including trust, fairness, integrity, and, though often overlooked in an organizational context, the reasons why people work.Business leaders, human resource professionals, organizational consultants, and students in these fields will appreciate this fresh perspective on people management, and the mini-cases and interviews with senior executives provide inspiring real-world examples.",128,2023,pdf,6 MB,['Robert Grosse'],Routledge,English,3.84,"['Business', 'Management']",Computer

272,3685592,Cleaning and Corporate Management: The Historical and Theoretical Relationship Between Japanese Companies and Their Cleaning Activities,"This book provides a new way of understanding Japanese management by focusing on the relationship between Japanese companies and their social practices. Whereas previous studies have often concentrated on the uniqueness of Japanese companies' systems (e.g., lifetime employment, the seniority system, company-specific unions) or methods (e.g., bottom-up management, Toyota production methods), this book explains the uniqueness of Japanese companies’ activities and practices. It especially highlights the day-to-day cleaning activities that many companies have practiced for numbers of years, regardless of their size or industry. Activities that continue beyond a certain period of time are called social practices, and the book clarifies how this particular social practice has historically been formed in Japanese companies and then shows what it means to keep cherishing those cleaning practices. This study consists of two parts: historical research and theoretical research. The historical research sheds light on the relationship between Japanese companies and cleaning activities from a historical point of view. On the basis of old literature and in-house documents, the reader can understand how Japanese companies have positioned cleaning practices in the process of increasing their growth potential and competitiveness and in maintaining their businesses.The second part explains theoretically the relationship between cleaning and management with quantitative and qualitative data from Japanese companies today. Using survey results from Japanese companies, the book shows what kinds of organizations will be formed and human resources will be developed if companies have been focusing for many years on 5S activities―Sort, Set in Order, Shine, Standardize, and Sustain― that include cleaning. This part of the book presents the distinctive problem-solving and strategy-creation processes of Japanese companies in contrast to the activities of European and American companies.",121,2023,pdf,2 MB,['Shin Ohmori'],Springer,English,3.59,"['Business', 'Management']",Computer

278,3703119,Solidarity and Organization: Toward New Avenues for Management,"Solidarity is an ‘unthought’ in the fields of organizational theory and management sciences. However, it is an increasingly important feature in the management of organizations. The contemporary world suffers from a double unsustainability: the abusive exploitation of natural resources endangers the balance of the climate and biodiversity, while growing inequalities condemn our ability to maintain a balanced society. These unsustainabilities are mutually reinforcing and call for the affirmation of a double solidarity, which unites humans among themselves, and links humans and nonhumans. Such an effort cannot be decreed. It must be organized.Based on numerous grassroots initiatives and citizens’ experimentations that are being invented every day around the world and on a historical and anthropological approach, this book explores different ways of combining solidarity and organization. Solidarity-based management, governance of the commons, and Buen Vivir approaches are some of the perspectives analyzed in the context of a North-South dialogue in order to formulate the conceptual framework and practical steps of a social and environmental transition. It offers both theoretical background and living examples to students, professors and researchers to better understand and better teach new avenues for management.",262,2023,pdf,5 MB,"['Philippe Eynaud', 'Genauto Carvalho de França Filho']",Palgrave Macmillan,English,3.46,"['Business', 'Management']",Computer

282,3710665,"Creating Value for Leaders: Balancing the Interests of Customers, Employees, Investors, and the Marketplace","Creating value is the foundation of all business. It’s what sets you apart from your competition, secures long-term customers, and brings distinct meaning to your brand and your stakeholders. Without creating value for your business, your unique offering will be seen as just another commodity in the eyes of your target market. Creating value is in every business leader’s vocabulary and uppermost in their overall strategy. In fact, creating value is the purpose of a company according to the Business Roundtable and the World Economic Forum. That is another key reason why more people want to understand and utilise value creation for their benefit and the good of their stakeholders.Many companies and leaders seek to create value but do not know how to. As a result, they create and destroy value unconsciously. This book shows you how to create value consciously. To create long-term value, organizations need to put in place the mindset, capabilities, and relationships that enable them to meet the needs of their customers and stakeholders.This book makes value creation understood and used by executives and leaders more effectively. The book describes value creation in its various nuances, how it arises, how it is used, and the width and scope of value creation, from how it impacts a company and how that company can become more successful by creating value for customers and other stakeholders.

284,3717119,An Empirical Study of SOE Corporate Governance Attributes for Emerging Markets,"This book investigates the institutional characteristics of state-linked firms in Vietnam to draw lessons for investors/MNCs targeting Vietnam and other emerging markets in the region. Vietnam and many other ASEAN countries have gone through a period of privatization and equitization of wholly controlled SOEs, with the State retaining partial ownership in many privatized businesses. This book explains the dynamic relationships between the State, BODs, shareholders, and regulators and their influence on corporate governance and SOE performance. This book differs from other publications in that it extrapolates the findings from our study to a broader context on how the defined internal mechanisms implicate the local economy and global supply chains/markets.This book investigates robust theoretical foundations, and rigorous applied empirical research underpin the role of the State in SOEs. It differs from other studies in terms of qualitative and empirical research to provide the contextual setting to elucidate how to successfully navigate emerging market business with the State as an ""owner-participant."" This book explains the theoretical constructs of corporate governance in SOEs, applies empirical research methodologies, and draws results to validate inferences to (1) investigate the link between the board of directors and ownership attributes and agency cost levels using Vietnamese listed firms for the period from 2006 to 2013, (2) evaluate the effectiveness of State's corporate initiatives and monitoring through its sovereign wealth fund known as the State Capital Investment Corporation (SCIC), and (3) infer and explain the motivation of the State as a shareholder. This book takes cognizance of Vietnam's idiosyncratic institutional (using its sovereign wealth fund as an investment vehicle and management proxy), economic, regulatory, and corporate environments and the realities for developing an effective and sustainable business model, vis-à-vis the ownership structure, board of directors' composition and corporate governance, for better business performance. While the focus is on Vietnam, the content is also relevant to the role of the State in other emerging markets as a player in shaping the business strategy, model, and direction of SOEs.",256,2023,pdf,5 MB,"['Giang Hoang', 'Kok Boon Oh']",Springer,English,4.68,"['Business', 'Management']",Computer

299,3077874,Подумайте еще раз. Сила знания о незнании,"Интеллект обычно рассматривается как способность думать и учиться, но в быстро меняющемся мире есть еще один набор когнитивных навыков, которые могут иметь большее значение: способность переосмысливать и переучиваться. В повседневной жизни слишком многие из нас предпочитают комфорт убеждений неудобству сомнений. Мы прислушиваемся к мнениям, которые заставляют нас чувствовать себя хорошо, а не к идеям, призывающим задуматься. Мы рассматриваем разногласия как угрозу нашему эго, а не как возможность учиться. Мы окружаем себя людьми, которые согласны с нашими выводами, тогда как нам следует тяготеть к тем, кто бросает вызов нашему мыслительному процессу.Если знание — это сила, то знание того, чего мы не знаем, — это мудрость.

Его новая книга поможет:• Освоить навык, который Рэй Далио в своих «Принципах» называет ключевым — умение смотреть на реальность без предубеждений.• Открыть в себе внутреннего Ученого: бесконечно любопытного, настроенного скептически, в меру уверенного в себе. Научиться менять взгляд на вещи.• Формировать содержательные, а не межличностные конфликты, чтобы вести свою команду или группу к поиску решения.• Подталкивать других людей к тому, чтобы они пересматривали устоявшееся видение и мыслили в рамках научного подхода.• Создавать сообщество людей, которые учатся новому в течение всей жизни.Обо всем этом Адам Грант рассказывает увлекательно, с юмором и примерами из самых разных сфер, с блестяще подобранными иллюстрациями и графиками, которые способствуют легкости чтения.Книга Адама Гранта показывает, что нам не нужно верить всему, что мы думаем, или усваивать все, что чувствуем.

Roberts explores the many different kinds of mindapps, including meditation, other psychoactive plants and chemicals, sensory overload and deprivation, biofeedback and neurofeedback, hypnosis and suggestion, sleep and lucid dreaming, creative imagery, transcranial brain stimulation and optical brain stimulation, rites of passage, martial arts and exercise routines, yoga, breathing techniques, and contemplative prayer. He also looks at the future of mindapps, the potential for new mindapps yet to be invented, and how installing multiple mindapps can produce new, yet to be explored mind states. Drawing on decades of research, he shows how psychedelics in particular are ""ideagens""—powerful tools for generating new ideas and new ways of thinking.Uniting the many forms of mindapps into one overall Multistate Mind Theory, Roberts examines the singlestate fallacy—the myth that useful thinking only occurs in our ordinary awake mental state—and demonstrates the many mind-body states we are capable of. He shows how mindapps not only allow us to design and redesign our own minds but also offer benefits for artistic performance, mystical and spiritual experience, and scientific research by improving creativity, open-mindedness, problem solving, and inner-brain connections. Reformulating how we think about the human mind, Mindapps unveils the new multistate landscape of the mind and how we can each enter the world of mind design.",256,2019,epub,2 MB,['Thomas B.

L’état d’éveil est un état d’être plus expansif et plus harmonieux que l’état normal, qui peut être cultivé ou qui peut se produire accidentellement. Cet état peut également être un processus dont nous faisons collectivement l’expérience. S’inspirant de ses années de recherche en tant que psychologue et de ses propres expériences, Steve Taylor nous donne ce qui est peut-être l’étude psychologique la plus claire jamais publiée sur l’état d’éveil.

312,2810692,La formation de la personnalité par la désintégration positive,"Pour le psychologue et psychiatre Kazimierz Dabrowski, la personnalité ne va pas de soi elle doit être consciemment créée et développée par l' individu. Dans son second ouvrage en langue anglaise, ""La formation de la personnalité par la désintégration positive"", publié pour la première fois en 1967, le Dr Dabrowski traite de la personnalité de manière exhaustive et toujours pertinente, peut-être encore plus de nos jours qu'à l'époque de sa rédaction. Dans ce livre, Dabrowski décrit les caractéristiques individuelles et universelles de la personnalité, les méthodes qui participent à son façonnage, et présente des études de cas de personnalités célèbres comme Saint-Augustin et Michel-Ange qui démontrent la nature concrète et normative du développement de la personnalité. Cette édition comprend l'introduction originale rédigée par l'ancien président de l'American Psychological Association, O. Hobart Mowrer, une annexe détaillant une étude conduite par le Dr Dabrowski sur les enfants surdoués et les aptitudes exceptionnelles, ainsi que des articles biographiques inédits analysant la personnalité de Beethoven, Kierkegaard et Unamuno. Fondé sur la théorie de la désintégration positive de Dabrowski, ""La formation de la personnalité"" introduit les concepts au coeur de cette théorie et du potentiel humain, de la créativité, de l'aide apportée à la société, du conflit interne, de la maladie mentale et de la croissance personnelle. La perspective globale de Dabrowski est à la fois une alternative rafraîchissante aux théories et aux courants unidimensionnels omniprésents en psychologie, et en soi une affirmation pleine et entière de tous ces aspects de la nature humaine qui sont trop souvent marginalisés, ignorés ou niés résultat sincère et révolutionnaire des observations incisives et de la vision globale du Dr Dabrowski. Kazimierz Dabrowski (1902-1980) a développé sa théorie de la désintégration positive au cours de sa carrière de psychologue clinicien et de psychiatre, et l'a exposée dans plus de trente livres et deux cent cinquante articles en diverses langues. Il a été professeur et directeur de Recherche clinique et d Internat à l'université de l Alberta.Biographie de l'auteur :Kazimierz Dabrowski (1er sept. 1902 - 26 nov. 1980) fut psychologue, psychiatre, pédagogue ainsi qu'un auteur prolifique qui publia plus de 30 livres et 250 articles en diverses langues. Il obtint des diplômes en médecine (1929) et en psychologie (1931), des certificats en psychanalyse (sous la direction de Wilhelm Stekel à Vienne, 1934) et en santé publique (univ. de Harvard, 1934), ainsi que des habilitations en psychothérapie infantile (univ. de Genève, 1934) et en psychiatrie (univ. de Wroclaw, 1948), entre autres distinctions. Dabrowski étudia aussi sous la direction de certaines des personnalités les plus éminentes de son domaine, que ce fut en Pologne ou à l' étranger, dont Jean Piaget, Pierre Janet, Édouard Claparède et Stefan Blachowski. En 1935, il fonda l'Institut d'Hygiène mentale à Varsovie, qu'il dirigea jusqu'en 1948. Sous l'occupation nazie, Dabrowski et ses collègues se servirent de l'établissement pour cacher des soldats polonais, des réfugiés, des médecins et des prêtres impliqués dans la résistance. Il fut arrêté par la Gestapo en 1942. En 1950, les autorités communistes l'arrêtèrent avec son épouse et il fut incarcéré durant dix-huit mois. Après sa libération, ses activités furent assujetties à des restrictions rigoureuses jusqu'à ce que sa « réhabilitation » ne soit déclarée en 1956. Au cours de sa carrière, il enseigna et donna des conférences dans de nombreuses universités du monde entier, et occupa en particulier une chaire de psychologie expérimentale à Varsovie en 1956, ainsi qu'un poste de professeur et de directeur de Recherche clinique et d'Internat à l'univ. de l'Alberta à partir de 1964.

Тим Харфорд, экономист, колумнист Financial Times, который работал во Всемирном банке и преподавал в Оксфорде, утверждает, что толика хаоса в нашей жизни может стать катализатором удивительных свершений. Используя примеры из нейробиологии, психологии, социологии, а также жизни людей, которые меняли историю и совершали революции в экономике и бизнесе, автор доказывает, что способности к творчеству и инновациям напрямую связаны с беспорядком и смятением. На русском языке публикуется впервые.""Экономист под прикрытием"" Тим Харфорд рассказывает, как немного беспорядка и хаоса могут сделать вас креативнее и продуктивнее.Идея, на которой основана эта книга, в том, что мы часто поддаемся соблазну ""опрятного разума"", когда на самом деле нам лучше поддаться определённой степени беспорядка.Это относится к публичному оратору, который остается верным сценарию, военачальнику, который тщательно прорабатывает стратегию, писателю, который стремится не отвлекаться, политику, который ставит измеримые цели в сфере общественных услуг, боссу, который настаивает на чистых столах у всех, руководителю группы, который стремится, чтобы все члены команды ладили друг с другом. Мы поддаемся соблазну чистоты в нашей повседневной жизни, когда тратим время на архивацию почты, заполняем анкеты на сайтах знакомств, которые обещают подобрать нам идеального партнера, или отправляем детей на местную детскую площадку вместо того, чтобы позволить им свободно бегать по району.Конечно, иногда стремление наводить чистоту - наше, казалось бы, врождённое желание создать мир упорядоченный, подлежащий количественной оценке, аккуратно структурированный по чётким категориям, спланированный и предсказуемый - полезно. Иначе этот инстинкт не укоренился бы так сильно.Но зачастую чистота нас так соблазняет своими уговорами, что нам не удаётся оценить преимущества беспорядка - неопрятного, неопределённого в количественном выражении, импровизированного, неидеального, непоследовательного, невыстроенного, загромождённого, бессистемного, неоднозначного, неконкретного, сложного, неоднородного или даже грязного. Речь по сценарию упускает энергию аудитории, внимательный военачальник теряется из-за более импульсивного противника, писатель по счастливой случайности находит вдохновение благодаря случайному отвлечению, количественные цели создают ошибочные стимулы, работники в чистом офисе чувствуют себя беспомощно и теряют мотивацию, чужак с другим мировоззрением ухудшает отношения в команде, но привносит свежий взгляд. Сотрудник с беспорядочно организованной входящей почтой в конце концов выполняет больше дел. Мы находим родственную душу, когда игнорируем анкеты на сайтах. Дети, свободно бегающие по улицам, не только весело проводят время и учатся новым навыкам, но и также - вопреки ожиданиям - реже попадают в аварии.Эта книга поможет вам стать креативнее, воспитать стойкость и раскрыть лучшие качества вашей личности.Для кого эта книгаДля каждого, кто любит неожиданные и противоречащие интуиции идеи и истории. Для всех, кто хочет стать креативнее и обратить беспорядок и хаос себе во благо.Об автореТим Харфорд - автор бестселлеров ""Экономист под прикрытием"" и ""Логика жизни"", член редакционного совета Financial Times и автор колонки ""Дорогой экономист"".

315,2222669,Failure Is An Option: An Attempted Memoir,"H. Jon Benjamin--the lead voice behind Archer and Bob's Burgers--helps us all feel a little better about our own failures by sharing his own in a hilarious memoir-ish chronicle of failure.Most people would consider H. Jon Benjamin a comedy show business success. But he'd like to remind everyone that as great as success can be, failure is also an option. And maybe the best option. In this book, he tells stories from his own life, from his early days (""wherein I'm unable to deliver a sizzling fajita"") to his romantic life (""how I failed to quantify a threesome"") to family (""wherein a trip to P.F. Chang's fractures a family"") to career (""how I failed at launching a kid's show""). As Jon himself says, breaking down one's natural ability to succeed is not an easy task, but also not an insurmountable one. Society as we know it is, sadly, failure averse. But more acceptance of failure, as Jon sees it, will go a long way to making this world a different place . . . a kinder, gentler place, where gardens are overgrown and most people stay home with their pets. A vision of failure, but also a vision of freedom.With stories, examples of artistic and literary failure, and a powerful can't-do attitude, Failure Is an Option is the book the world doesn't need right now but will get regardless.",256,2018,pdf,10 MB,['H.

But what if researchers viewed the brain not as the foundation of life, rather as a mediating organ?Ecology of the Brain addresses this very question. It considers the human body as a collective, a living being which uses the brain to mediate interactions. Those interactions may be both within the human body and between the human body and its environment.Within this framework, the mind is seen not as a product of the brain but as an activity of the living being; an activity which integrates the brain within the everyday functions of the human body. Going further, Fuchs reformulates the traditional mind-brain problem, presenting it as a dual aspect of the living being: the lived body and the subjective body - the living body and the objective body. The processes of living and experiencing life, Fuchs argues, are in fact inextricably linked; it is not the brain, but the human being who feels, thinks and acts.For students and academics, Ecology of the Brain will be of interest to those studying or researching theory of mind, social and cultural interaction, psychiatry, and psychotherapy.",336,2018,epub,2 MB,['Thomas Fuchs'],"Oxford University Press, USA",English,4.82,"['Psychology', 'Creative Thinking']","Psychology, CreativeThinking"

Professors Ramakrishna Rao and Anand Paranjpe draw the contours of Indian psychology, describe the methods of study, explain crucial concepts, and discuss the central ideas and their application, illustrating them with insightful case studies and judicious reviews of available research data and existing scholarly literature. The main theme is organized around the thesis that psychology is the study of the person and that the person is a unique composite of body, mind and consciousness. The goal of the person is self-realization. Self-realization consists in the realization of one’s true self as distinct from the manifest ego and it is facilitated by cultivating consciousness. Cultivating consciousness leads to a kind of psycho-spiritual symbiosis resulting in personal transformation, altruistic value orientation and flowering of the hidden human potential.",388,2017,epub,929 kB,"['K.

330,2394020,A Defense of Rule: Origins of Political Thought in Greece and India,"At its core, politics is all about relations of rule. Accordingly one of the central preoccupations of political theory is what it means for human beings to rule over one another or share in a process of ruling. While political theorists tend to regard rule as a necessary evil, this book aims to explain how rule need not be understood as anathema to political life. Rather, by looking at some of the earliest traditions of political thought we can rethink rule in ways that evoke stewardship rather than domination.Stuart Gray argues that hierarchical ideas about rule coevolved with political divisions between the human and non-human in western theory. The earliest discernible Greek thought advanced an instrumental relationship between humans and their environment, a position that has persisted into our current age. While this seems a defensible position, Gray points out that such instrumental understandings of the nonhuman world have gotten us into serious trouble, including problems of deforestation, global warming, rising sea levels, species loss, and peak oil.To rethink the concept of rule,A Defense of Ruleturns to early Indian political thought that suggests that rule is a relationship predicated on stewardship. The book compares these two traditions of thought in order to suggest that we have a normative duty to the environment, and thus to act in a way that takes the interests of non-human nature into account. Basing his argument on his own original translations of primary sources in ancient Greek and Sanskrit, Gray shows when and how early concepts of rule evolved to justify divisions between the human and nonhuman. In doing so, he argues for a reconsideration of our duties toward the nonhuman natural world.",304,2017,epub,1 MB,['Stuart Gray'],Oxford University Press,English,4.43,"['Psychology', 'Creative Thinking']","Psychology, CreativeThinking"

This means environmental risks are a priority to study in a formal way. At the same time, innovation risks are present in theminds of leaders, newknowledge brings new risk, and the adaptation and adoption of risk knowledge is required to better understand the causes and effects can have on technological risks. These opportunities require not only adopting new ways of managing and controlling emerging processes for society and business, but also adapting organizations to changes and managing new risks.Risk Analytics: Data-Driven Decisions Under Uncertainty introduces a way to analyze and design a risk analytics system (RAS) that integrates multiple approaches to risk analytics to deal with diverse types of data and problems. A risk analytics system is a hybrid system where human and artificial intelligence interact with a data gathering and selection process that uses multiple sources to the delivery of guidelines to make decisions that include humans and machines. The RAS system is an integration of components, such as data architecture with diverse data, and a risk analytics process and modeling process to obtain knowledge and then determine actions through the new knowledge that was obtained. The use of data analytics is not only connected to risk modeling and its implementation, but also to the development of the actionable knowledge that can be represented by text in documents to define and share explicit knowledge and guidelines in the organization for strategy implementation.This book moves from a review of data to the concepts of a RAS.

But in this revolutionary book, Cyrus Khambatta, PhD, and Robby Barbaro, MPH, rely on a century of research to show that advice is misguided. While it may improve short-term blood glucose control, such a diet also increases the long-term risk for chronic diseases like cancer, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, chronic kidney disease, and fatty liver disease.The revolutionary solution is to eat a low-fat plant-based whole-food diet, the most powerful way to reverse insulin resistance in all types of diabetes: type 1, type 1.5, type 2, prediabetes, and gestational diabetes.As the creators of the extraordinary and effective Mastering Diabetes Method, Khambatta and Barbaro lay out a step-by-step plan proven to reverse insulin resistance-the root cause of blood glucose variability- while improving overall health and maximizing life expectancy. Armed with more than 800 scientific references and drawing on more than 36 years of personal experience living with type 1 diabetes themselves, the authors show how to eat large quantities of carbohydrate-rich whole foods like bananas, potatoes, and quinoa while decreasing blood glucose, oral medication, and insulin requirements. They also provide life-changing advice on intermittent fasting and daily exercise and offer tips on eating in tricky situations, such as restaurant meals and family dinners. Perhaps best of all: On the Mastering Diabetes Method, you will never go hungry.With more than 30 delicious, filling, and nutrient-dense recipes and backed by cutting-edge nutritional science, Mastering Diabetes will help you maximize your insulin sensitivity, attain your ideal body weight, improve your digestive health, gain energy, live an active life, and feel the best you've felt in years.",400,2020,epub,15 MB,"['Cyrus Khambatta', 'PhD', 'Robby Barbaro', 'MPH']",Penguin Publishing Group,English,4.38,"['Medicine', 'Diabetes']","Medicine, Diabetes"

New evidence, however, indicates that rapamycin treatment produces some benefits to energy metabolism, even in the context of T2D. Here, we survey 5 mouse models of T2D (KK, KK-Ay, NONcNZO10, BKS-db/db, TALLYHO) to quantify effects of rapamycin on well-recognized markers of glucose homeostasis within a wide range of T2D environments. Interestingly, dietary rapamycin treatment did not exacerbate impaired glucose or insulin tolerance, or elevate circulating lipids as T2D progressed. In fact, rapamycin increased insulin sensitivity and reduced weight gain in 3 models, and decreased hyperinsulinemia in 2 models. A key covariate of this genetically-based, differential response was pancreatic insulin content (PIC): Models with low PIC exhibited more beneficial effects than models with high PIC. However, a minimal PIC threshold may exist, below which hypoinsulinemic hyperglycemia develops, as it did in TALLYHO. Our results, along with other studies, indicate that beneficial or detrimental metabolic effects of rapamycin treatment, in a diabetic or pre-diabetic context, are driven by the interaction of rapamycin with the individual model’s pancreatic physiology.Corresponding Author:David E.

426,2539882,There Is a Cure for Diabetes: The 21-Day+ Holistic Recovery Program,"This substantially revised edition offers an innovative approach to the prevention and healing of chronic diabetes degenerative syndrome (CDDS), Dr. Gabriel Cousens's new definition of diabetes. Written for those with diabetes and pre-diabetes, as well as those with normal fasting blood sugars who have abnormal glucose spikes, about 85% of the population, it represents a major breakthrough in understanding the synergy that helps heal diabetes and includes an expanded recipe section with more than 140 recipes in total--80% new, 90% raw, and 10% cooked. Dr. Cousens's Diabetes Recovery Program, the most successful anti-diabetes program in the world, reverses diabetes to a physiology of health and well-being by resetting the genetic expression of a person's DNA. It focuses on a 25-35% low complex carbohydrate, live food, plant-source-only diet as a powerful energetic healing catalyst for upgrading the epigenetic and genetic program and anti-inflammatory force.Dr. Cousens, a leading medical authority in the world of live-food nutrition and an internationally known spiritual teacher, exposes the dangers of a low-cholesterol, low-omega 3 diet in terms of increased rates of suicide, violence, aggression, depression, and anxiety and highlights the dangers of excess glucose and fructose in the world diet as the key physical causal factors in the creation of the pandemic of diabetes. His recent study, recounted in a completely new chapter and based on 110 clients (compared to just 11 previously) in his Diabetes Recovery Program, shows an extraordinary, almost unbelievable, outcome: in total, 97% of all type 2 diabetics were off all medication in 21 days. Specifically, 61% of non-insulin-dependent type 2 diabetics, 28% of insulin-dependent type 2 diabetics, 31.4% of non-insulin-dependent type 1 diabetics, and 10% of insulin-dependent type 1 diabetics were consistently healed. Dr. Cousens's research also shows that his diet creates significant anti-aging and revitalizing energies and is appropriate for anyone who is seeking to create holistic health and greater vitality. This is not only a diet for healing the pandemic of diabetes; it is the evolutionary diet of the present as well as for the future healing of humanity and the preservation of the planet.

447,326973,Diabetes-Handbuch: Eine Anleitung für Praxis und Klinik,"Eines steht spätestens nach der Lektüre dieses Buches fest: Innere Medizin ist nicht langweilig! Die Nephrologie mit ihren vielen Schnittpunkten zu anderen Fachgebieten bietet dem Praktiker schier unerschöpflichen Raum zur Wissensvertiefung und Selbstentfaltung. Christine Kellers Praxis der Nephrologie berücksichtigt außer den klassischen internistischen Fragestellungen, zum Beispiel im Rahmen des Diabetes mellitus oder der Hypertonie, auch die diffizilen praktischen Probleme im Zusammenhang mit der Dialyse und der Nierentransplantation. Das Buch beginnt naturgemäß mit der Darstellung der normgerechten Nierenanatomie und -funktion und schildert dann das allgemeine diagnostische Vorgehen. Spannend wird es bei den glomerulären Nierenerkrankungen (mit der notorischen Verwechslung von Nephrotischem und Nephritischem Syndrom wird hier gründlich aufgeräumt) und erst recht bei den Systemerkrankungen mit Nierenbeteiligung. Dabei verliert sich der Text keineswegs in theoretischen Abhandlungen etwa zur Pathophysiologie der Rheumatoiden Arthritis oder der Sarkoidose -- was ja an dieser Stelle für den Wissenschaftler verlockend wäre --, sondern hält sich strikt an die für die nephrologische Praxis wichtigen und belegten Fakten. Zur Hochform läuft das Buch beim Thema Dialyse auf: Nach einem so praktischen Leitfaden mit allen Formeln, Faustregeln und Richtwerten für den klinischen Alltag muss man sonst lange suchen. Das Kapitel zur Transplantation glänzt mit einer hervorragenden Darstellung der Transplantationsimmunologie und immunsuppressiven Therapie; das rein chirurgische Vorgehen spielt hier natürlich nur eine untergeordnete Rolle. Einen ausgezeichneten Eindruck hinterlässt auch die ausführliche tabellarische Übersicht über alle gängigen Präparate mit ihrer veränderten Pharmakokinetik bei Niereninsuffizienz im Anhang des Buches. Ohnehin machen die Abschnitte zur Pharmakotherapie, zur Schwangerschaft sowie zur Arteriellen Hypertonie allgemein das Werk für jeden Hausarzt und Internisten und nicht zuletzt auch für den ambitionierten Medizinstudenten interessant.

This book investigates the epidemiology of diabetes in these minority communities, arguing that the determinants of diabetes include not only personal choices, but also broader social and contextual factors, such as community racism, residential segregation, and cultural patterns. This book includes in-depth analyses of many community-based interventions which serve African-American, Hispanic/Latino American, Asian American, and Native American populations. The author also provides suggestions for community-based initiatives to reduce the ''obesogenic'' environment many minorities live in. Key features: Includes effective intervention approaches for prevention and control of diabetes in racial and ethnic populations Explores the influence of institutionalized racism and residential segregation on the emergence of diabetes and obesity Presents extensive case studies detailing the experiences, challenges, and breakthroughs of various community health initiatives and programs This book will serve as an important resource for professors, students, community leaders, policymakers, health practitioners, and anyone interested in joining the movement to eliminate health disparities and achieve health equity.",400,2009,pdf,1 MB,['Leandris C.

The volume addresses a variety of current scientific discussions about mechanisms of damage such as growth factors and the VEGF/PEDF balance in the diabetic eye, the ocular renin-angiotensin system, and leukocyte interactions with the microvasculature among others. Stem and progenitor cells in the retina are discussed as potential directions for future investigation. The final chapters return to emerging clinical aspects, including current approaches to retinopathy as a predictor of cardiovascular risk and how knowledge can be translated from bench to bedside. Bridging a widening gap in medical research between basic scientists, who may lose sight of the clinical presentations, and clinical researchers, who may grow unaware of the limits of experimental models, this volume serves as a reference platform for endocrinologists, diabetologists, ophthalmologists, as well as for scientists involved in clinical and basic research in diabetic retinopathy and other vascular complications of diabetes.",232,2009,pdf,3 MB,"['H.

Том Шиппи подходит к этому вопросу с научной точки зрения: он рассуждает о жанровой принадлежности, стилистике и языке произведений Толкина, рассматривает созданные им образы и полномасштабную мифологию.

474,2394304,O cadete e o capitão: a vida de Jair Bolsonaro no quartel,"Uma investigação sobre um momento controverso na trajetória de Jair Bolsonaro: o abandono da carreira militar e o ingresso na vida política.Jair Bolsonaro tornou-se uma figura pública em 1986, quando assinou na revista Veja um artigo em que reclamava do baixo soldo pago aos militares. Um ano depois, nas páginas da mesma revista, reapareceu numa reportagem que revelava um plano de estourar bombas em locais estratégicos do Rio de Janeiro. A revista publicou um desenho que detalhava o plano. O croqui, supostamente de autoria do capitão, comprovaria a conspiração em curso no Exército. Instado a prestar contas, Bolsonaro foi considerado culpado no primeiro julgamento, e mais tarde inocentado pelo Superior Tribunal Militar (stm). Após a decisão da corte, deixou a farda, passou à reserva e ingressou na política. Esta é a reportagem mais completa já escrita sobre esse período pouco conhecido. O autor examinou a documentação do processo (reproduzida no livro) e escutou as mais de cinco horas de áudio da sessão secreta ― ambos disponíveis no stm. Também entrevistou personagens que atuaram no caso, entre jornalistas de Veja e militares colegas de Bolsonaro. Além de reunir indícios suficientes para apontar que a autoria do croqui, como sustentou Veja até o fim, era mesmo do capitão, Maklouf reconstitui um episódio decisivo não apenas para a trajetória do presidente eleito em 2018, mas também para a redemocratização e o jornalismo no Brasil. 88 páginas com imagens e documentos",208,2019,pdf,19 MB,['Luiz Maklouf Carvalho'],Todavia,Portuguese,3.47,"['Literature', 'Fantasy']","Literature, Fantasy"

Why does cancer develop? What's the connection between heart failure and Alzheimer's disease, or infertility and hearing loss? Can we extend lifespan, and if so, how? What is the Exercise Paradox? Why do antioxidant supplements sometimes do more harm than good? Many will be amazed to learn that all these questions, and many more, can be answered by a single point of discussion: mitochondria and bioenergetics. In Mitochondria and the Future of Medicine, Naturopathic Doctor Lee Know tells the epic story of mitochondria, the widely misunderstood and often-overlooked powerhouses of our cells. The legendary saga began over two billion years ago, when one bacterium entered another without being digested, which would evolve to create the first mitochondrion. Since then, for life to exist beyond single-celled bacteria, it's the mitochondria that have been responsible for this life-giving energy. By understanding how our mitochondria work, in fact, it is possible to add years to our lives, and life to our years. Current research, however, has revealed a dark side: many seemingly disconnected degenerative diseases have tangled roots in dysfunctional mitochondria. However, modern research has also endowed us with the knowledge on how to optimize its function, which is of critical importance to our health and longevity. Lee Know offers cutting-edge information on supplementation and lifestyle changes for mitochondrial optimization, such as CoQ10, D-Ribose, cannabinoids, and ketogenic dietary therapy, and how to implement their use successfully. Mitochondria and the Future of Medicine is an invaluable resource for practitioners interested in mitochondrial medicine and the true roots of chronic illness and disease, as well as anyone interested in optimizing their health.",272,2018,epub,3 MB,['Lee Know'],Chelsea Green Publishing,English,3.82,"['Medicine', 'Popular scientific literature']",Literature

Beginning with a thorough reconstruction of Shklar's life and her interest in political theory, Gatta turns her attention to examining the tension between Shklar's critique of the term ""modernity"" and her passion for Enlightenment thinkers, including Rousseau and Hegel. In the second part of the book, Gatta roots Shklar's liberalism of permanent minorities in her work in the history of political thought, and highlights this contribution as a fundamental recasting of liberalism as the political philosophy of outsiders. She makes a compelling argument for a liberalism of permanent minorities that refuses to stand on the ground of firm foundations and, instead, is oriented by complex understandings of cruelty and fear.Rethinking Liberalism for the 21st Century is a much-needed reorientation of traditional liberal policies, allowing for a more meaningful intervention in many contemporary debates. As such, it will be of interest to scholars of political theory, the history of political thought and ideas, philosophy, international relations, and political science in general.",154,2018,pdf,2 MB,['Giunia Gatta'],Routledge,English,3.11,"['Medicine', 'Popular scientific literature']",Literature

In this 4th book of the Rational Male series author, Rollo Tomassi, connects the dots between human beings' evolved mating imperatives and the spiritual beliefs spawned by them that still influence society in the data age.

570,2616402,Счастье вместе. Нескучное руководство по семейной жизни,"Исчерпывающее руководство о том, как быть счастливыми в браке. В основе — научные данные, советы специалистов и личный опыт автора.Белинда Ласкомб в течение 20 лет писала для журнала Time о браке и отношениях. Проанализировав мнения сотен разных пар и данные последних научных исследований, она выявила шесть основных проблем, с которыми сталкиваются супруги: отсутствие близости, неумение ссориться, финансовые разногласия, отношения с детьми и близкими родственниками, сексуальные проблемы и отказ от помощи. В книге Белинда предлагает читателю захватывающий коктейль из результатов научных исследований, житейских историй и мудрых наблюдений на самые разные темы — от того, как справедливое разделение домашних обязанностей улучшает сексуальную жизнь, до того, какую пользу приносит мощная семейная ссора (только не в автомобиле, когда кто-то из супругов за рулем!).Автор предлагает простую, реализуемую и нескучную методику управления браком и техосмотра взаимоотношений, призванного выяснить, отчего они барахлят — может, достаточно всего лишь сменить масло? Спойлер: оставаться вместе проще, чем кажется.От автораЯ всегда с подозрением относилась к подушечкам, на которых вышит старый добрый совет: не ложиться спать сердитым. С какой это стати? Почему двое людей — когда они устали, да и мысли у них путаются — должны непременно выяснять отношения, прежде чем отойти ко сну? Или я ничему не научилась из общения с маленькими детьми? Они же устраивают самые ужасные истерики, именно когда хотят спать! Проведенное в 2017 году исследование подтвердило мои догадки. Новобрачных просили оценить их брак, и ответы тех, кого опрашивали поздно вечером, на сон грядущий, были самыми мрачными. Ради бога, ложитесь спать сердитыми, потому что вам обоим необходим отдых! Даже если вы отодвинулись друг от друга как можно дальше и чуть не падаете с кровати, даже если натянули пижамы, которые месяц не надевали, даже если, засыпая, проговариваете в уме все то, что намерены обрушить на свою вторую половину утром. И даже если не можете уснуть (после того, как честно пытались) — после перерыва, с первыми лучами зари, разговор все равно получится более цивилизованным и разумным.Для кого эта книга• Для тех, кто готов работать над отношениями• Для тех, кто хочет сохранить брак• Для тех, кто стремится к взаимопониманию и гармонии в семьеОб автореБелинда Ласкомб в течение двадцати лет была штатным автором журнала Time, где писала о взаимоотношениях, браке, воспитании детей и характерных для XXI века переменах в роли женщины.

584,2498775,Mantieni il bacio. Lezioni brevi sull'amore,"Chi ha detto che l'empatia sia necessaria per fondare una buona relazione? Che l'amore sia anzitutto dialogo? E se quelle del ""dialogo"" e dell'""empatia"" fossero delle parole d'ordine finalizzate proprio a scongiurare l'alterità dell'Altro, la sua radicale e irriducibile differenza, il suo essere straniero? Se la condizione di ogni amore non fosse dialogo ma l'incontro con un segreto indecifrabile, con un mistero che resiste a ogni sforzo empatico? Lacan affermava che il rapporto sessuale è impossibile, è sempre fallito. Non posso mai sentire quello che l'altro sente, confondermi, coincidere, essere lui. Ma è proprio dall'esperienza di questo fallimento che diviene possibile l'amore come amore per l'eteros. Si tratta di provare a condividere proprio l'impossibilità di condividere il rapporto. Se ti amo non è perché dialogo con te ma perché in te c'è qualcosa di te e di me che mi sfugge, impossibile da raggiungere. Scopro, cioè, in te un segreto che mi supera e si distanzia da ogni empatia possibile. Per questo Lacan identificava l'amore con la donna, se la donna è - come è - il nome più radicale del segreto impossibile da decifrare. In una ricerca intima e profonda, Massimo Recalcati indaga il miracolo dell'amore, il sentimento più misterioso di tutti. «La fedeltà non è una prigione, né una gabbia,» spiega, «se si trasforma in un sacrificio bisogna liberarsi. La fedeltà diventa una postura dell'amore perché trasforma lo stesso in nuovo, non c'è bisogno di andare altrove per trovarlo. Come quando guardiamo un'alba sorgere: l'abbiamo vista mille volte ma non ci stancheremmo mai di ammirarla, ogni volta ci appare diversa, nuova».",125,2019,pdf,463 kB,['Massimo Recalcati'],Feltrinelli,Italian,3.58,"['Psychology', 'Love, erotic']","Psychology, LoveErotic"

As an active participant in this community, Valerie Bauman uses her own story as a lens into this movement of people attempting to dodge the costly and often discriminatory world of sperm banks and fertility clinics. Inconceivable is a window into the unfair legal, financial, and medical entanglements that compel many single women and LGBTQ+ couples to take their fertility into their own hands.ABOUT THE AUTHOR:Valerie Bauman is an award-winning journalist with nearly two decades of experience. She is currently an investigative reporter at Newsweek.

593,3416825,"""Venomous"" Bites from ""Non-Venomous"" Snakes","""Venomous"" Bites from ""Non-Venomous"" Snakes, Second Edition thoroughly examines the potential hazards associated with bites by non-front-fanged snakes (popularly, but inaccurately, called ""rear-fanged snakes""). This diverse group contains approximately 80% of living snake species (approximately 2,900 species). A large proportion of these snakes were previously assigned to the family Colubridae but, as a consequence of expanding systematics investigations, have been split into multiple families and subfamilies. Many of these snakes produce venoms or oral secretions that contain toxins and other biologically active substances. A large variety of non–front-fanged snakes figure in the pet industry, yet little documented information or formal study of their potential medical importance has been published. Therefore, although the possible medical importance of many of these species has been subjected to speculation since the mid-19th century, there is a limited amount of useful descriptive information regarding the real hazard (or lack thereof) of this wide variety of snakes.The first edition of this book provided ""one-stop shopping"" by offering information regarding their possible toxicity and clinical relevance as well as recommendations for medical management of their bites. The second edition expands and updates the content with detailed information about the effects and medical management of bites by a broad representation of non–front-fanged species. The hypothetical venomous nature of some lizards considered as non-venomous such as the Komodo monitor or dragon and their allies, as well as the medical effects of their bites, is also examined. The dynamic taxonomy of advanced snakes is updated, and the bases for some of these fluid changes are discussed. Likewise, terminology is also updated in order to reflect the ongoing debates regarding the definition of ""venom"" and the balanced reinforcement of nonmedical criteria used to define the biological basis of the term ""venomous.""",788,2023,pdf,20 MB,"['Scott A Weinstein', 'David A.

Variously described as Long-COVID, Long-Haulers’ Syndrome, and Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2, this newly-designated disorder is estimated to have affected somewhere between 50 to 250 million people. It is in fact considered by many as the next global public health disaster. With such a broad and important topic, the authors of Unravelling Long COVID have focused primarily on two major problems in the current understanding of Long-COVID: 1.) the failure to distinguish patients with organ damage—here called Long-COVID Disease – and those with unexplained, persistent symptoms—what is termed Long-COVID syndrome, and 2.) the failure of current medical approaches to comprehend and treat those persistent unexplained symptoms. Unravelling Long COVID is: One of the first books focused specifically on defining and understanding Long-COVID with the goal of establishing optimal management A unique reference to distinguish patients with organ damage caused by Long-COVID disease from those with unexplained, persistent symptoms that manifest as Long-COVID syndrome An in-depth exploration of neuroimmune pathways to help clarify the previously unexplained symptoms of Long-COVIDUnravelling Long COVID isan essential reference for anyone interested in Long-COVID and the impact that this condition has had on the population.

Based on their extensive research and experience with chronic pain care, science, ethics, and policy, the authors look beyond the usual villains-pharmaceutical companies and pharmacotherapy distributors-to examine the ethical and scientific concepts about pain that made the opioid epidemic possible. The book explores the history of pain in Western society, the role of innovation in end-of-life care, the conception of pain control as an important medical responsibility, and the various models of pain that have led to our current understanding of it, ultimately arguing that we must reintegrate pain with the rest of human suffering as a necessary part of a full life. Containing patient vignettes as well as scientific and policy controversies that have emerged as the opioid epidemic has evolved, The Right to Pain Relief and Other Deep Roots of the Opioid Epidemic examines these implications in a more human and holistic way than has been ever addressed before by the popular press and professional literature.",300,2023,epub,7 MB,"['Mark D.

Medical schools often under prepare junior doctors for these tasks so they tend to request large numbers of tests to make sure 'all bases are covered' by the time a more senior colleague attends to the patient.Beginning with naïve questions such as 'what is a medical test?' and 'why do we perform tests?', the book also covers the evaluation of tests from a public health perspective and helps the readers to determine whether a test should be introduced into clinical care. By describing the basics of medical decision making based on probability thresholds, students will learn how to avoid unnecessary testing when results are unlikely to influence patient relevant decisions, and the pros and cons of using metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values. Illustrated throughout with real life examples from multiple medical and surgical specialties, it concludes with a novel checklist for doctors to consider every time they think of requesting a test.Written by a clinician for clinicians, this book is ideal for medical students and junior doctors.

607,3553018,Supporting Individuals Who Use Augmentative and Alternative Communication: Breaking Down Opportunity Barriers,"Individuals with complex communication needs who use Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) frequently encounter barriers that limit their ability to achieve their full potential in communication and in life. These barriers include access barriers (limitations in the current capabilities of the AAC user or the communication systems that they use) as well as opportunity barriers (e.g., policy, practice, knowledge/skill, and attitude barriers that extend beyond the AAC user). It is essential to consider both access and opportunity barriers when designing systems and supports for individuals who use AAC. However, often the emphasis of research and practice is on addressing issues related to access barriers with far less attention to opportunity barriers. Supporting Individuals Who Use Augmentative and Alternative Communication: Breaking Down Opportunity Barriers is the first book to focus specifically on practical strategies for breaking down opportunity barriers experienced by individuals who use AAC. The text is divided into four sections, with each section devoted to a frequently encountered opportunity barrier (knowledge/skill, practice, attitude, and policy). Within each section, readers will (a) develop a deeper understanding of the impact of the barrier through the eyes of individuals who use AAC or their families, (b) acquire knowledge based on current research and recommended practices related to addressing the barrier, and (c) learn how professionals have successfully addressed the barrier via case examples from the field. The final chapter provides readers with information (as well as tools and examples) about how to go “beyond the book” and actively address the unique opportunity barriers they encounter. Key FeaturesIncludes in-depth interviews with individuals who use AAC and their familiesIdentifies evidence-based and promising practices for addressing opportunity barriers Provides tips, tools, and resources for addressing opportunity barriers Illustrates successful strategies for addressing opportunity barriers through case examples and step-by-step guidelines for implementationIncludes contributions from professionals in the field who have successfully addressed opportunity barriers in home, school, workplace, and community settingsWho Should Read This BookThis book is designed to support those who find themselves frustrated by the opportunity barriers experienced by individuals who use AAC and are searching for ways to break down those barriers, including people who rely on AAC, speech-language pathologists, special education teachers, occupational therapists, physical therapists, family members, university students, faculty in higher education, and other professionals in school, healthcare, and community settings.",296,2023,pdf,7 MB,"['Susan S.

Start your Linux journey today with this essential guidebook.Linux-based operating systems have been around for over 30 years. Although it may not be as well-known as its proprietary counterparts, such as Microsoft Windows or Apple’s macOS, Linux is actually much more prevalent than you might think. In fact, it powers many of the devices that you use on a daily basis, from smartphones to servers to supercomputers.One of the key benefits of Linux is its open-source nature. This means that anyone can access and modify the source code, making it a highly customizable and flexible operating system. This has led to a vast array of different distributions (or “distros”) of Linux, each tailored to specific needs and uses. For example, there are distros for developers, for desktop users, for gaming, and for enterprise-level servers.Another benefit of Linux is its stability and security. Because the source code is open and constantly being improved upon by a large community of developers, bugs and vulnerabilities are often found and fixed quickly. Additionally, Linux is less susceptible to malware and viruses compared to other operating systems, making it a popular choice for secure and sensitive applications.Despite its many advantages, Linux is not without its challenges. One of the main obstacles for new users is the command-line interface, which can be intimidating for those who are used to a graphical user interface (GUI). However, once users become familiar with the command line, they often find it to be a powerful and efficient tool for managing their devices and applications.",36,2023,pdf,1 MB,['Frank Anemaet'],Leanpub,English,3.58,"['Computers', 'Operating Systems']","Computer, OperatingSystem"

640,3697691,Windows 11 Field Guide,"The Windows 11 Field Guide is a full-length e-book about the latest version of Microsoft Windows, aimed at those users who will upgrade from Windows 10 or acquire Windows 11 with a new PC.Microsoft describes Windows 11 as being “fresh and familiar,” and while that sounds paradoxical, it’s true. That is, Windows 11 offers a fresh new user experience that is simpler, prettier, and more modern than that of its predecessor, Windows 10. But it is also instantly familiar, providing all of the same basic interfaces that Windows users expect, know, and use.Windows 11 soldiers forward with all of the security features from Windows 10. But it also includes some enhancements. Windows 11-based PCs must have Secure Boot and a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 chipset available and enabled, for example, which raises the security baseline for the entire ecosystem, for example. And Smart App Control takes the browser-based SmartScreen technologies from the past, improves them with AI-based application trust prediction capabilities, and integrates it directly into the operating system, ensuring that unsafe apps won’t run.Like its predecessor, Windows 11 ships with two command-line shells–the MS-DOS-like Command Prompt and Windows PowerShell–and you can optionally install one or more Linux command-line shells via the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) as well. But Windows 11 also includes a new application called Windows Terminal that lets you access these command-line environments–plus the Azure Cloud Shell–from a single, tab-based interface.Windows 11 also ships with Microsoft’s Power Automate for desktop, a so-called “low-code” automation solution that helps you optimize workflows and automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks visually.Windows 11 includes a hardware virtualization feature called Hyper-V that lets you run Windows and other operating systems in virtual machines (VMs). This technology is useful for a variety of reasons. For example, developers can use Hyper-V to test their applications and other software in other versions of Windows or in other operating systems.",833,2023,epub,93 MB,['Paul Thurrott and Rafael Rivera'],leanpub.com,English,3.4,"['Computers', 'Operating Systems']","Computer, OperatingSystem"

This makes Linux a versatile option for many different situations. Linux is also known for its strong security. Because it is open source, any security problems can be quickly found and fixed by the community. Linux also has strong rules about permissions and access, which makes it tough for harmful software to break in. Regular updates also help keep Linux safe and secure.Linux also provides good support for virtualization, which lets users create and manage virtual machines (VMs) efficiently. With tools like Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) and Xen, Linux allows users to run more than one operating system at the same time on a single machine. This is really useful in server environments, where virtualization makes things like software deployment and resource management easier.On top of this, Linux is the go-to platform for container technologies like Docker and Kubernetes. Containers create isolated environments for applications, making them easier to move and run on different systems. Linux’s built-in features, such as namespaces and cgroups, are the backbone of containerization. These features make it easier to manage resources, isolate processes, and scale up. By bringing together Linux and containerization, software development and deployment have become faster and more efficient.Having discussed the diverse capabilities and advantages of Linux, it’s essential to recognize the challenges that come with mastering it. Red Hat exams, for instance, are tough, and not many first-time test-takers pass the RHCSA exam. But don’t let that scare you. While passing isn’t guaranteed, this book is designed to help you prepare for and hopefully pass the RHCSA exam. The skills described in this book can also help you in your job as a Linux administrator.

Infectious diseases are one of the major to cause significant losses of DALY and QALY. Human infectious diseases are disorders that are triggered by the micro-organisms such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, or parasites. The majority of such diseases are contagious and create a public health menace. There are several reasons why infectious diseases are deadly diseases, and one of the primary reasons is the drug resistance developed over time. Drug resistance-associated mutations are linked to increasing drug efflux, modifications of the drugs, or their targets. Every year, new drugs are being approved by FDA to treat infectious diseases. Nonetheless, the infectious diseases will undoubtedly persist as permanent and main threats to humanity for now and in the future, primarily due to increased longevity that almost always comes at a cost of impaired immunity.A total of four books are covered under the series of Infectious drug diseases.- Malarial drug delivery systems- Tubercular drug delivery systems- Viral drug delivery systems- Infectious disease drug delivery systemsThe third volume of series is focused on viral drug delivery systems. Typically, virus attaches to the cells (referred as host cell) and releases its DNA or RNA inside the cell. In second stage, virus’s genetic material takes control of the cell and forces it to replicate the virus leading to onset of disease symptoms. DNA class of viruses include Herpes, Papilloma and Adeno viruses. RNA class of viruses include retroviruses, such as HIV immunodeficiency virus and SARS COV – 2 / Corona virus. This book addresses recent developments in viral drug delivery systems.

By the end of the book, it is still your choice to follow that path, but you have all you need to consider the offer. I’ve been part of the growth process of two widely different languages: Ruby and Rust - by programming them, but also by running events, being part of their project management and running business around them. Through that, I had the privilege of being in touch with many of the creators of those languages and consider some of them friends. Rust has been my one chance in life to see and help a language grow from the experimental stage to adoption in the industry.Rust was never intended to be a research platform - it was always meant as a programming language solving real, tangible issues in large codebases. It is no surprise that it comes out of an organization that maintains a very large and complex codebase - Mozilla, creators of Firefox. When I joined Rust, it was just ambition - but the ambition was to industrialize research to make the software of tomorrow better. With all of its theoretical concepts, linear typing, region based memory management, the programming language was always meant for everyone. This reflects in its lingo: Rust uses accessible names like “Ownership” and “Borrowing” for the concepts I just mentioned. Rust is an industry language, through and through.You'll learn how to:Navigate and leverage Rust's crates ecosystemStructure your application to make it modular and extensibleWrite tests, from single units to full-blown integration testsEnforce your domain invariants using Rust's type systemAuthenticate and authorize users of your APIImplement a robust error handling strategyObserve the state of your application using structured logsSet up an extensive continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline for your Rust projectsThe book is composed of 11 chapters, for a grand total of 600 pages. All supporting code (including tests!) is available on GitHub.Who Is This Book For:The Rust ecosystem has had a remarkable focus on smashing adoption barriers with amazing material geared towards beginners and newcomers, a relentless effort that goes from documentation to the continuous polishing of the compiler diagnostics. There is value in serving the largest possible audience.At the same time, trying to always speak to everybody can have harmful side-effects: material that would be relevant to intermediate and advanced users but definitely too much too soon for beginners ends up being neglected. I struggled with it first-hand when I started to play around with async/await.There was a significant gap between the knowledge I needed to be productive and the knowledge I had built reading The Rust Book or working in the Rust numerical ecosystem. I wanted to get an answer to a straight-forward question:Can Rust be a productive language for API development?Yes.But it can take some time to figure out how.That’s why I am writing this book.I am writing this book for the seasoned backend developers who have read The Rust Book and are now trying to port over a couple of simple systems.I am writing this book for the new engineers on my team, a trail to help them make sense of the codebases they will contribute to over the coming weeks and months.I am writing this book for a niche whose needs I believe are currently underserved by the articles and resources available in the Rust ecosystem.I am writing this book for myself a year ago.",601,2024,pdf,4 MB,['Luca Palmieri'],Independently Published,English,3.05,"['Computers', 'Programming']","Computer, Programming"

849,4216457,Wonderstruck: How Wonder and Awe Shape the Way We Think,"""What explains people's propensity to ask existential questions that they have little hope of resolving, such as: Why are we here? What, if any, is our purpose? What is the structure of the universe? That humans engage in these endeavors has long puzzled evolutionary theorists, as they go beyond the immediate demands of fending for ourselves, seeking safety, finding food, and reproducing, which occupy the daily lives of other animals. In this book, philosopher Helen De Cruz draws on a wide range of disciplines and thinkers, from Aristotle and 12th-century Muslim philosopher Ibn Tufayl to Jewish thinker Abraham Heschel and science writer Rachel Carson, showing how awe and wonder lie at the heart of such existential questions. She argues that there is an emotional basis to this drive for inquiry, as wonder and awe are epistemic emotions that help us think about big-picture questions and that motivate the answers we provide to those questions""--",232,2024,pdf,6 MB,"['De Cruz', 'Helen']",Princeton University Press,English,4.69,['Psychology'],Psychology

The experience of pure consciousness—what does it look like? What is the essence of human consciousness? In The Elephant and the Blind, influential philosopher Thomas Metzinger, one of the world's leading researchers on consciousness, brings together more than 500 experiential reports to offer the world's first comprehensive account of states of pure consciousness. Drawing on a large psychometric study of meditators in 57 countries, Metzinger focuses on “pure awareness” in meditation—the simplest form of experience there is—to illuminate the most fundamental aspects of how consciousness, the brain, and illusions of self all interact.Starting with an exploration of existential ease and ending on Bewusstseinskultur, a culture of consciousness, Metzinger explores the increasingly non-egoic experiences of silence, wakefulness, and clarity, of bodiless body-experience, ego-dissolution, and nondual awareness. From there, he assembles a big picture—the elephant in the parable, from which the book's title comes—of what it would take to arrive at a minimal model explanation for conscious experience and create a genuine culture of consciousness.

It defines core principles associated with modern security policies, processes, and protection; illustrates them with up-to-date sidebars and examples; and shows how to apply them in practice. Modular and flexibly organized, it supports a wide array of courses, strengthens professionals' knowledge of foundational principles; and imparts a more expansive understanding of modern security.This edition adds or expands coverage of artificial intelligence and machine learning tools; app and browser security; security by design; securing cloud, IoT, and embedded systems; privacy-enhancing technologies; protecting vulnerable individuals and groups; strengthening security culture; cryptocurrencies and blockchain; offensive cyberwarfare; post-quantum computing; and more. It contains many new diagrams, exercises, sidebars, and examples, and is mapped to two leading frameworks: the US NIST National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) and the UK Cyber Body of Knowledge (CyBOK).Because programmers make mistakes of many kinds, we can never be sure all programs are without flaws. We know of many practices that can be used during software development to lead to high assurance of correctness. This chapter surveys programs and programming: errors programmers make and vulnerabilities attackers exploit. These failings can have serious consequences, as reported almost daily in the news. However, there are techniques to mitigate these shortcomings. In this section we presented several characteristics of good, secure software. Of course, a programmer can write secure code that has none of these characteristics, and faulty software can exhibit all of them. These qualities are not magic; they cannot turn bad code into good. Rather, they are properties that many examples of good code reflect and practices that good code developers use; the properties are not a cause of good code but are paradigms that tend to go along with it. Following these principles affects the mindset of a designer or developer, encouraging a focus on quality and security; this attention is ultimately good for the resulting product and for its users.Cryptography is a specialized topic that depends on several areas of mathematics and theoretical computer science, including number theory, finite field algebra, computational complexity, and logic. After reading this overview, you would need to develop a significant background to study cryptography in depth. And we caution you strongly against studying a little cryptography and concluding that you can design your own secure cryptosystem. The field of cryptography is littered with failed approaches designed even by experts, so nonexperts are well advised to “leave the driving to the professionals.”Remember from Chapter 2 that cryptanalysis is the act of studying a cryptographic algorithm, its implementation, plaintext, ciphertext, and any other available information to try to break the protection of encryption. A cryptanalyst’s chore is to break an encryption. That is, the cryptanalyst attempts to deduce the original meaning of a ciphertext message. Better yet, the cryptanalyst hopes to determine which decrypting algorithm, and ideally which key, match the encrypting algorithm to be able to break other messages encoded in the same way.Core security concepts: Assets, threats, vulnerabilities, controls, confidentiality, integrity, availability, attackers, and attack typesThe security practitioner's toolbox: Identification, authentication, access control, and encryptionAreas of practice: Securing programs, userinternet interaction, operating systems, networks, data, databases, and cloud computingCross-cutting disciplines: Privacy, management, law, and ethicsUsing cryptography: Solve real problems, and explore its formal and mathematical underpinningsEmerging topics and risks: AI and adaptive cybersecurity, blockchains and cryptocurrencies, computer-assisted offensive warfare, and quantum computing",1417,2024,epub,15 MB,"['Charles P.

885,4203430,Enterprise Cyber Risk Management as a Value Creator : Leverage Cybersecurity for Competitive Advantage,"This book will help you learn the importance of organizations treating enterprise cyber risk management (ECRM) as a value creator, a business enabler, and a mechanism to create a competitive advantage. Organizations began to see the real value of information and information technology in the mid-1980s. Forty years later, it’s time to leverage your ECRM program and cybersecurity strategy in the same way.The main topics covered include the case for action with specific coverage on the topic of cybersecurity as a value creator, including how the courts, legislators, and regulators are raising the bar for C-suite executives and board members. The book covers how the board’s three primary responsibilities (talent management, strategy, and risk management) intersect with their ECRM responsibilities.ECRM was once solely focused on managing the downside of risk by defending the organization from adversarial, accidental, structural, and environmental threat sources. Author Bob Chaput presents the view that we must focus equally on managing the upside of cyber strengths to increase customer trust and brand loyalty, improving social responsibility, driving revenue growth, lowering the cost of capital, attracting higher quality investments, creating competitive advantage, attracting and retaining talent, and facilitating M&A work. He focuses on the C-suite and board role in the first part and provides guidance on their roles and responsibilities, the most important decision about ECRM they must facilitate, and how to think differently about ECRM funding. You will learn how to the pivot from cost-center thinking to value-center thinking.Having built the case for action, in the second part, the book details the steps that organizations must take to develop and document their ECRM program and cybersecurity strategy. The book first covers how ECRM must be integrated into business strategy. The remainder of that part presents a sample table of contents for an ECRM Program and Cybersecurity Strategy document and works through each section to facilitate development of your own program and strategy. With all the content and ideas presented, you will be able to establish, implement, and mature your program and strategy.What You Will LearnRead new information and treat ECRM and cybersecurity as a value creatorReceive updates on legal cases, legislative actions, and regulations that are raising the stakes for organizations, their C-suites, and boardsThink differently about funding ECRM and cybersecurity initiativesUnderstand the most critical ECRM decision that boards must facilitate in their organizationsUse practical, tangible, actionable content to develop and document your ECRM program and cybersecurity strategy“This book should be mandatory reading for C-suite executives and board members. It shows you how to move from viewing cybersecurity as a risk to avoid, and a cost center that does not add value and is overhead, to seeing cybersecurity as an enabler and part of your core strategy to transform your business and earn customer and stakeholder trust.”—Paul Connelly, First CISO at the White House and HCA HealthcareWho This Book Is ForThe primary audience includes Chief Information Security Officers, Chief Risk Officers, and Chief Compliance Officers.

909,4254898,Secure Coordination Control of Networked Robotic Systems : From a Control Theory Perspective,"As one of the core equipments and actuators, robotic technology has attracted much attention and has made great progress. However, a single robotic system is often unable to handle complex tasks due to limitations in sensors, microprocessors, actuators, and the ability to handle complex situations. With the development of distributed control and microprocessing technology, networked robotic systems have greatly expanded their perceptual, computational, and execution capabilities, with high efficiency, low cost, and strong functionality advantages. As a typical distributed cyber-physical system (DCPS), which is an intelligent system that integrates computing, communication, and control, networked robotic systems can perform higher-level tasks by sharing information and working together. It can provide intelligent control and monitoring of a physical process, such as environment observation, information collection, and search and rescue, etc. Thus, coordination control of networked robotic systems has become the focus of scholars worldwide. However, the sensing, communication, and control integration of networked robotic systems make them face unprecedented network security threats, in which cyber attacks have become a major hidden danger to the reliable operation of autonomous unmanned systems. Although existing control methods can achieve swarm collaborative control of networked robotic systems, the protection of which, especially the security of control systems, is rarely addressed.In this book, we conduct research on the secure coordination problem of networked robotic systems from a control theory perspective, given the limited communication bandwidth and the increasingly prominent network security threats. This book showcases several continuous-time and event-triggered secure control design and analysis methods for networked robotic systems under different types of cyberattacks.

932,3574288,PKI Implementation and Infrastructures,"The concept of a PKI (public key infrastructure) has been around for decades, but it is one strand of IT which has taken an extraordinarily long time to come to fruition within the mainstream. This is mostly because implementing a PKI is time consuming and difficult. Maintaining a PKI is equally time consuming and even more difficult within the real world of mergers and acquisitions against a backdrop of ever-changing technology. Many organisations simply give up and hand everything over to a third party who promises to manage everything on their behalf. This is generally not a good idea and simply delays the inevitability of failures and misunderstood complexity. This book explores all the aspects of implementing and maintaining a PKI that the other books on the subject seem to miss. It reflects decades of hard-won experience, not only in PKI, not only in IT, not only in electronics, but in business, government agencies and academia alike. The book also explores the existence of a PKI alongside other technologies, such as biometrics, and against an ever-changing world of development methodologies. This last point is particularly relevant at this time as we are in the middle of a quiet, but all encompassing revolution in this respect. Consequently, this is the one book on PKI that you have to have on your shelf, whether you be a company director, IT manager, government minister or teacher of IT. It is the book which fills in all the gaps left in the literature and treads paths which others fear to tread.

It contains many new diagrams, exercises, sidebars, and examples, and is mapped to two leading frameworks: the US NIST National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) and the UK Cyber Body of Knowledge (CyBOK).Because programmers make mistakes of many kinds, we can never be sure all programs are without flaws. We know of many practices that can be used during software development to lead to high assurance of correctness. This chapter surveys programs and programming: errors programmers make and vulnerabilities attackers exploit. These failings can have serious consequences, as reported almost daily in the news. However, there are techniques to mitigate these shortcomings. In this section we presented several characteristics of good, secure software. Of course, a programmer can write secure code that has none of these characteristics, and faulty software can exhibit all of them. These qualities are not magic; they cannot turn bad code into good. Rather, they are properties that many examples of good code reflect and practices that good code developers use; the properties are not a cause of good code but are paradigms that tend to go along with it. Following these principles affects the mindset of a designer or developer, encouraging a focus on quality and security; this attention is ultimately good for the resulting product and for its users.Core security concepts: Assets, threats, vulnerabilities, controls, confidentiality, integrity, availability, attackers, and attack typesThe security practitioner's toolbox: Identification, authentication, access control, and encryptionAreas of practice: Securing programs, userinternet interaction, operating systems, networks, data, databases, and cloud computingCross-cutting disciplines: Privacy, management, law, and ethicsUsing cryptography: Solve real problems, and explore its formal and mathematical underpinningsEmerging topics and risks: AI and adaptive cybersecurity, blockchains and cryptocurrencies, computer-assisted offensive warfare, and quantum computing",960,2023,epub,6 MB,"['Charles Pfleeger', 'Shari Lawrence Pfleeger', 'Lizzie Coles-Kemp']",Addison-Wesley Professional,English,4.77,"['Computers', 'Security']","Computer, Security"

939,3617318,Reading Plato through Jung: Why must the Third become the Fourth?,"This book examines the Jungian imperative that the Third must become the Fourth through the lens of Carl Jung’s complex reception of Plato. While in psychoanalytic discourse the Third is typically viewed as an agent that brings about healing, the author highlights that, in the case of Jung, an early emphasis on the Third as the “transcendent function” gave way to an increasing insistence on the importance of the Fourth. And yet, he asks, why must “the Third become the Fourth”? Paul Bishop begins with a survey of work on Jung’s relation to Plato, before turning to Jung’s readings of the Timaeus and Black Books, as well as Goethe’s Faust II and Nietzsche’s Zarathustra. He proceeds to unpick Jung’s statements on the Third and the Fourth though a compelling analysis of how Jung draws upon religious and alchemical traditions, Pythagorean numerology, his own dream-like experiences and Plato’s cosmology. This book will appeal to practitioners and to scholars working in the history of ideas, psychoanalysis, philosophy, and psychoanalytic theory.",161,2023,pdf,4 MB,['Paul Bishop'],Palgrave Pivot,English,4.18,"['Medicine', 'Therapy']","Medicine, Therapy"

944,4135883,"Fat, Stressed, and Sick : MSG, Processed Food, and America's Health Crisis","Fat, Stressed, and Sick: MSG, Processed Food, and America's Health Crisis shows how glutamate (aka MSG) in processed food fuels food addictions and makes us sick.,Presents the scientific evidence that glutamate-aka MSG-in processed food contributes to a suite of preventable inflammatory diseases.Fat, Stressed, and Sick makes the case that processed food compromises health not just because of added sugar, salt, and fat, but also because these foods contain significant amounts of glutamate-aka MSG. MSG makes food deliciously addicting. What was not well-known until described here is that most of the MSG in processed food is created during food manufacturing. As the authors show, food processing of protein alone adds 10 grams or more a day of MSG to the average American diet-a statistic that may surprise you.The book details the research linking dietary glutamate to a suite of inflammatory diseases: obesity, diabetes, autism, addiction, depression, and cancer, to name a few. Understanding the role of MSG in disease became the quest of author and biochemist Katherine Reid when she learned that her young daughter's autism symptoms were associated with inflammation of the brain. Reid made the connection between inflammation and glutamate in the diet-a connection amply supported by other studies. A deep dive into food manufacturing patents and FDA regulations revealed that, in addition to industry practices that create MSG during food processing, MSG is also found in ingredients labeled ""hydrolyzed protein,"" ""yeast extract,"" and even ""natural flavors,"" misleading labels that disguise a food's true MSG content. In what became an experiment in her home kitchen, Reid examined every ingredient on every food label, removing all items with MSG and replacing them with whole foods. The results were swift and undeniable. Reid's discovery that what one ate mattered was the start of a program of food-based solutions to chronic inflammatory illnesses, through which now, a decade later, she has helped thousands of people. The idea that large amounts glutamate in the diet jeopardizes health is supported by decades of research, despite efforts by the glutamate industry to discredit the scientific evidence that MSG poses a risk. Some would have you believe the science is settled. It is not. This book explains the science behind why we crave the MSG in processed food, why it is hidden, how it is making us sick, and what we can do about it.",296,2023,pdf,6 MB,"['Katherine Reid', 'Barbara Price']",Rowman & Littlefield Publishers,English,4.87,"['Medicine', 'Therapy']","Medicine, Therapy"

951,3356249,Hip and Knee Pain Disorders,"Hip and Knee Pain Disorders has been written to provide a state-of-the-art, evidence-informed and clinically-informed overview of the examination and conservative management of hip/knee pain conditions. Under the current predominantly evidence-based practice paradigm, clinician expertise, patient preference, and best available research determine examination, and prognostic and clinical management decisions. However, this paradigm has been understood by many to place greater value and emphasis on the research component, thereby devaluing the other two. Evidence-informed practice is a term that has been suggested to honor the original intent of evidence-based practice, while also acknowledging the value of clinician experience and expertise.In essence, evidence-informed practice combines clinical reasoning, based on current best evidence, with authority-based knowledge and a pathophysiological rationale derived from extrapolation of basic science knowledge. Unlike other published textbooks that overemphasize the research component in decision-making, this book aims to address the clinical reality of having to make decisions on the management of a patient with hip/knee pain, in the absence of a comprehensive scientific rationale, using other sources of knowledge. It offers an evidence-informed textbook that values equally research evidence, clinician expertise and patient preference.The book is edited by three recognised world leaders in clinical research into manual therapy and chronic pain. Their research activities are concentrated on the evidence-based management of musculoskeletal pain conditions using conservative interventions. For this book they have combined their knowledge and clinical expertise with that of 38 additional contributors, all specialists in the field The contributors include a mix of clinicians and clinician-researchers.Hip and Knee Pain Disorders is unique in bringing together manual therapies and exercise programs in a multimodal approach to the management of these pain conditions from both a clinical, but also evidence-based, perspective. It acknowledges the expanding direct access role of the physical therapy profession.

Spastic paresis is the consequence of a central nervous system disorder such as a stroke, traumatic brain or spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, or a tumor of the nervous system, conditions that may have occurred in childhood or adulthood. In spastic paresis two problems coexist: the word 'paresis' means that when the brain sends a command to a muscle to contract, this order is incompletely received by the muscle; the word 'spastic' indicates that at the same time muscles cannot relax normally and have a tendency to be spontaneously overactive. A daily program of prolonged stretching and an intensive motor training program using unassisted large amplitude rapid alternating movements is recommended to gradually increase brain command effectiveness.",133,2022,pdf,19 MB,['Jean-Michel Gracies'],Springer,English,4.44,"['Medicine', 'Therapy']","Medicine, Therapy"

The explanations are supported by extensive photographs of each position and a set of 72 video clips to help readers follow and reproduce the techniques. This book explains the theory of Repetitive Facilitative Exercise (RFE), which is a combination of repetitive volitional flexion and extension movements from neurofacilitation approaches. This exercise is aimed at achieving the intended movements and lessening synergistic movement patterns by reconstructing and strengthening the neuropathways of the injured nerve tract. Instead of interpreting disorders based on reflex theory and constructing treatment methods, the new approach considers scientific treatment methods that emphasize the formation of neural pathways by improving synapse formation and transmission efficiency based on functional localization, central programs, and neural nets. Chapters provide a basic theory of RFE, offering the underlying mechanisms of nerve tract formation/strengthening, such as functional localization, voluntary movement, plasticity, and neural lateral sprouting, giving readers a comprehensive understanding of the prompt and repetitive therapy. This is followed by an exposition of practice and techniques, planning of treatment programs, and facilitation techniques for voluntary movements of the upper limb, individual fingers, and lower limb. Finally, the book introduces RFE to facilitate and enhance motor skills in walking and other functions. Exercise Therapy for Recovery from Hemiplegia - Theory and Practice of Repetitive Facilitative Exercise will provide rehabilitation therapists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and medical doctors a refreshing alternative theory and practice to current approaches.

966,3762221,Exercise Medicine for the Frailty Syndrome,"Frailty is a clinical syndrome caused by multiple chronic conditions that makes it difficult to maintain homeostasis. In part, it is the result of the body’s inability to regulate normal inflammatory responses that lead to muscle loss, decrease in strength, and independence. Regular exercise helps to optimize physiological performance. It is a profound influence, especially in the presence of physical inactivity, where the lack of exercise leads to poor health and decreased longevity. Unfortunately, a high percentage of Americans fail to engage in daily exercise with the older population becoming increasingly frail, which is a syndrome characterized by declines in musculoskeletal and physiologic reserve and function. It has been documented that exercise is medicine and can be better than the effects induced by drugs. Exercise physiologists are healthcare professionals. They are key professionals in developing and applying an exercise medicine prescription for frail adults.Exercise Medicine for the Frailty Syndrome speaks to the benefits of exercise medicine as the best therapy to prevent or reverse the age-related muscle loss and functional deficits that are predictive of an increase in falls, hospitalization, institutionalization, and mortality. This book is a proactive step to help increase the functional independence of older frail adults. It highlights Board Certification by the American Society of Exercise Physiologists as the professional qualification to improve society’s understanding of the biological treatment and complexity of the frailty syndrome and is key reading for Exercise Physiologists.",155,2022,pdf,2 MB,['Tommy Boone'],Routledge,English,4.29,"['Medicine', 'Therapy']","Medicine, Therapy"

As a physiotherapist, I have long been disappointed with how back pain in those over the age of 50 has been treated. Too much emphasis has been put on passive treatments such as massage, prescription pain medications, TENS and ultrasound, which rightly all have their time and place. But, an improved and more structured approach is needed.Over the past several years, I have successfully run a mobile physiotherapy company specializing in treating those over the age of 50. The most common ailment people see me for is–you guessed it–back pain.Since starting my mobile business, I have developed a 7 step action plan that I have implemented with all of my patients suffering with back pain. The program is simple, easy to follow and has been providing amazing results for my patients.The spine doesn’t work in isolation and has a close relationship with the body parts above and below it. A major hurdle, in my opinion, is that the standard approach to treating back pain looks at the back exclusively. My approach aims to fix this issue by implementing a treatment program that views the back and the rest of the body holistically, including possible external factors.In this book you will learn my 7-step plan to treating back pain, which includes:[list][*]A crash course on the anatomy of the back and the 3 key leg muscles you need to strengthen to help improve your pain.[*]The different diagnoses you can expect when your back hurts.[*]Why posture is so important and easy to apply, practical tips you can implement straight away to help.[*]The stretching, strengthening and cardiovascular components that are essential for all back programs.[*]2 other important variables which are not often overlooked when it comes to back pain.[/list]Before you buy this book I do not want to mis-lead any potential readers or let anyone down. The following are reasons you should NOT buy this book:[list][*]You have crippling severe back and/or leg pain which is constant all of the time.[*]You have numbness or loss of sensation in your groin region.[*]You have pain shooting down both legs at the same time.[/list]If you have any of the above symptoms I would strongly recommend that you seek medical advice in person in order to get an accurate diagnosis.If you are clear from these symptoms, then I think this book is just for you and will be able to help your back pain.

998,3268488,No bad parts : healing trauma and restoring wholeness with the internal family systems model,"“An enormous gift—transformative, compassionate, and wise. These simple and brilliant teachings will open your mind and free your spirit and your heart.”JACK KORNFIELD, PHD author of A Path with Heart“Internal Family Systems (IFS) therapy, and the understanding that we all contain valuable parts that are forced into extreme roles to deal with pain and disappointment, has been one of the great advances in trauma therapy. Understanding the role they have played in our survival and being able to unburden the original traumas leads to self-compassion and inner harmony. The notion that all of our parts are welcome is truly revolutionary and opens up a path to self-acceptance and self-leadership. IFS is one of the cornerstones of effective and lasting trauma therapy.”BESSEL VAN DER KOLK, MD author of The Body Keeps the ScoreAs I write this, we are amid the COVID-19 pandemic. It has the potential to be the wake-up call we need so we don’t suffer worse ones down the road, but it remains to be seen whether our leaders will use this painful pause to listen to the suffering of the majority of our people and also learn to collaborate rather than compete with other countries. Can we change nationally and internationally in the ways my clients are often able to?Many spiritual traditions stress the importance of loving, or at least having compassion for, yourself. IFS tells you precisely how to do that. For example, Kristin Neff and Chris Germer have brought a large and wonderful movement to the public called Mindful Self-Compassion, based on some Buddhist practices that are quite compatible with IFS. IFS makes such practices a little more concrete by helping you extend care and nurturance to specific parts that are suffering or are former enemies, and you can notice how they react.A deprogramming tool for Mass Formation Psychosis?",182,2021,pdf,1 MB,['Richard Schwartz'],,English,4.79,"['Medicine', 'Therapy']","Medicine, Therapy"

1000,3375621,Myofascial Induction,"Myofascial Induction™ - An anatomical approach to the treatment of fascial dysfunction describes the properties of the fascial network and provides therapeutic solutions for different types of fascial dysfunction. The material is presented in two volumes:Volume 1 analyzes in depth the theoretical aspects related to fascia and focuses on the therapeutic procedures of Myofascial Induction Therapy (MIT™) for the upper body; Volume 2 summarizes and expands on the theoretical aspects and explains the therapeutic procedures of MIT for the lower body.Volume 1 is divided into two parts:Part 1 - The Science and Principles of Myofascial Induction andPart 2 - Practical Applications of Myofascial Induction - the Upper Body.Part 1 defines the fascia as a complex biological system before discussing its multiple characteristics.Part 2 is the practical part. Here the reader will find a wide range of manual therapeutic procedures which can be selected and used to build up the MIT treatments. These processes are explained in detail and are richly illustrated, in full color, with diagrams and photographs of their practical application in the body and in the treated samples of dissected tissues.Each chapter opens with an introduction offering to the reader some philosophical background as a reminder that philosophy allows us to relate the strictly scientific with the empirical. Praxis and empiricism are the basis of science.The author invites you to join the scientific fascial adventure that allows us to uncover areas of knowledge which may have been forgotten or which are not yet recognized as being related and which might still reveal relevant information. Once discovered, these facts can help us to better understand the kinesis of our body and so help the individual to change their body image and to improve their quality of life.",606,2021,epub,277 MB,['Andrzej Pilat'],Handspring Publishing Limited,English,4.52,"['Medicine', 'Therapy']","Medicine, Therapy"
